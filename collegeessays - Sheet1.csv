The Noise of Ambiguity,"At the beginning of The Order of Things, author Michel Foucault, deciphers Diego Velazquez’s painting, “Las Minenas”. The painting is a controversial piece, highlighting the power of symbolism and superimposition. As a spectator viewing the painting, it seems as if Foucault establishes a direct relationship between the image and the spectator, in Velazquez’s point of view. The relationship between the spectator and the painting is ambivalent. In the passage, Foucault highlights the timelessness of the image while defining the painting’s purpose: infinite relation of language. The analysis of this painting is to emphasize the layers of representation in the use of space and symbolism. Foucault then deciphers the painting as a moment in real-time, connecting the intent of the artist to multiple interpretations. 
The article first calls attention to Velazquez’s control of the environment. The painting featured on the first page of the passage displays a painter looking directly at the spectator, in the midst of painting. The canvas used by the painter is turned away from the spectator while another painting defines itself in the center of the picture. At first glance, a spectator may contemplate the artist and what he is painting. Is it finished? Has he started? Who is the artist painting? In real-time, the blank canvas occupies a substantial amount of space in the painting, causing the spectator to wonder what the artist is painting instead of focusing on the rest of the painting. Foucault explains that Velazquez carefully placed each subject in the painting causing the spectator to immediately try to identify the subject of the painting. With the painter in the image looking directly at the spectator, Velazquez creates a direct relationship between the painter and the spectator. It is almost as if the painting is a break in dimension to have its spectator envision themselves in that current moment. Instead of the painting being a subject to look at, Velazquez creates an environment where the spectator is the subject of the painting. The characters in the painting are either looking at the artist or the spectator. 
At this time, Foucault takes his readers through a timeline of the story of Velazquez’s controversial painting. The portrait highlighted for spectators to see is an important indication of the spectator’s identity while looking at the painting. The painting establishes a relationship with its spectator by leaving clues to decipher with the multiple gazes of its characters, the canvas of the painter turn away from the spectator, the painting highlighted in the back, and the setting of the painting creating layers of meaning within itself. The painting becomes a moment in real-time rather than being a still image. Different aspects of the painting serve its rightful purpose to intentionally leave the spectator to decipher their identity in this painting. Velazquez intended for the spectator to be the subject of the painting. 
Without background knowledge of Velazquez’s painting, the passage calls attention to the absence of definite meaning, leaving it open to interpretation. Foucault mentions that we say what we see, but what we see never resides in what we say. In other words, our spoken language is inadequate to properly conveying the intent or message of an artist as well as define multiple layers of meaning.  In this case, the painting has multiple subjects that aid to preserve the ambiguity of the painting. Foucault then introduces the subjects, King Philip IV of Spain, his wife Mariana, the young Infanta, the maids of honor, the courtiers, the dwarves, and the jester. With this clarification, the spectator still remains the subject of the painting but assumes the identity of King Philip IV and his wife Mariana, having their portrait painted. 
Foucault completes his introduction by asking a series of questions that remain unanswered about the painting as well as highlighting the characters of the painting that were intentionally overlooked. Defined as essential invisibility, the spectator spends the most time deciphering their role instead of absorbing all aspects of the painting. They provide the center around which the entire representation is ordered. Las Meninas preserves its triple function, as Foucault would say, and fulfills its relation between the painter’s gaze, the spectator as he contemplates the painting, and the painter’s as he is composing his picture.

Dangers of Web 2.0,"The use of computers has revolutionized the world and the way we interact in it.  In fact, our culture has shifted from more of an Industrial to an Information age.  From how we conduct business to how we educate ourselves and solve problems, computers have played a pivotal role.  In Andrew Keen’s articles entitled The Noble Amaetur  and  Why we must resist the Temptation of the Web 2.0,  the author cautions users to be skeptical about what they read on the Web 2.0. Specifically, the author asserts that much of the information found on  Wikipedia, a popular resource on the Web 2.0 is based purely on opinions rather than facts.  As Keen states in his article, The Noble Amaetur, “ I believe it lies at the heart of Web 2.0’s cultural revolution and threatens to turn our intellectual traditions and institutions upside down ”, and Keen is referring to the fact that anyone can assert their opinion on the matter and not be required to be an expert on the subject.  Everything we've relied on in the past such as Encyclopedia Britannica for information has been shelved, and in its place is Web 2.0.  Many would argue that the Web 2.0 is a valuable resource but Keen was right in asserting that to rely on what he believed to be amateur information is dangerous, presents challenges and distracts from expert created content.  
	The danger comes from the fact, Keen believed, that Web 2.0 provides a platform for users to express unsubstantiated ideas.  With the onset of the Information age, it has given an avenue for people to express their opinions.  As Keen states in his article,  Why We Must Resist The Temptation Of Web 2.0, “Our technology platform will radically democratize culture.” What Keen is stating here is that everyone can weigh-in on a subject and assert their own opinion.  There is no need to be an educated expert on this subject.  Without specialized training, education, or experience, an individual can post their opinion to the Web 2.0 without having it verified.  This influences people to believe in misinformation that very well might not be true which would be dangerous to the public because if the reader spreads the information to others it could be the cause of the uproar.  Keen believes that the Web 2.0 empowers our creativity but it also levels the playing field between amateurs and experts because anyone and everyone can assert their unverified opinions on the Web 2.0.  This same sentiment is held by Sam Richter,  an author who shares Keen’s opinion and wrote a paper in the Journal of Material Handling Equipment Distribution Association.  In his article entitled, ‘The Dangers of Web 2.0’, Richter wrote, “What makes Web 2.0 so dangerous is that not only can you share information and distribute it on a global scale without the benefit of an editor, but worse, what you say online can be archived, and searchable by anyone-forever.  Meaning that one mistake can theoretically come back to haunt you for the rest of your life.”   Keen would agree with this statement because information is being disseminated on a large scale without professional input to verify the authenticity of the information.  In fact, Andrew Keen felt so strongly about the fact that amateurs are allowed to post to the Web 2.0 that he believes that with the use of Web 2.0 it will change the world in a dramatic way.  He believed that instead of having a world of experts, we’ll have a dictatorship of idiots.  In this statement Keen is referring to the fact that we are losing our reliance on individuals with expertise in an individual field and allowing an uneducated person to present their opinions as fact.

	In modern times most people rely heavily on the Web 2.0 because it's a way to find out anything quick but that may be risky because the information may not be accurate.  Being able to publish your opinion freely allows people to be deceived by almost everything we search on the Web 2.0.  No matter how scholarly your intentions you may end up searching for something that may not have as valid of an answer as you would expect.  While many people claim their advice to be derived from positions of authority they may be just saying that to elevate their status over others who may be doing the same thing.   This is a huge problem because it spreads false information, and gives the public a belief to talk about anything and be able to feel credible to talk about the subject.  According to Keen, although popular sites like Wikipedia do not charge a fee to use their site, it has perpetuated the spread of false information and Keen further believes that we the people suffer as a result.  He felt that individuals assume the information they are reading is valid and from a trusted source but it is not the case.  While this seemingly limitless supply of free information definitely has had some benefits to our society, it is also true that you get what you pay for, and with no cost information, you may end up being mislead. 
	It is evident that the Web 2.0 has made a huge impact and brought about drastic change and this change creates challenges as well.  Many people who could not get an education have been able to find ways to get educated through the Web’s vast stores of information.  Also people from oppressive regimes who are experts, now have that voice given back to them that was originally taken away by outside forces.  Despite these useful aspects of the Web 2.0, it still does not take away from the fact that much of the information remains unsubstantiated and can lead people astray leaving them less educated than they were before.   Even Keen himself acknowledged that there were some benefits to Web 2.0.  He felt it empowered our creativity but that it also leveled the playing field between expert and amateur.  Keen goes on to say, “If we can all at the same time be hunters, fishers, cattle herders, and critics, can any of us actually excel at anything?  In a world in which we are all amateurs, there are no experts.”  In other words, Keen is saying we cannot be masters of everything and we need to rely on individuals who are recognized as experts in their field.
	 Reliance on the Web 2.0 and knowing its misleading tendencies, Keen felt that this knowledge would make people more skeptical of information around them.  While this is good to combat the misleading information that can be found on Web 2.0, Keen felt it also causes people to be skeptical of truthful info as well leading to overall distrust of any information they come across.  In Keen’s article on the Noble Amateur, he states that “Democratized media will eventually force all of us to become amateur critics and editors ourselves.  With more and more of the information online unedited, unverified and unsubstantiated, we will have no choice but to read everything with a skeptical eye.”  Keen is saying here that individuals will need to fact check articles and information read on the Web and not believe everything read without verifying the facts.  
	The Web 2.0 has the potential to be an amazing resource that will advance human knowledge exponentially but the reality is there is the danger of relying on unverified information.  However, the public does have access to sources like the encyclopedia or dictionary to verify the information because if false information spreads it could be dangerous, and result in an uproar of misinformation being distributed on a global scale.  Web 2.0 is a great tool and can be utilized in many different ways, but as Keen so promotes, it’s a source that is based on people’s opinions and may be best off using a site that is credible and factual."
Rhetorical Analysis,"A well designed syllabus communicates information about a specific course and defines expectations and responsibilities. This course-planning tool helps set the foundation of rules and principles for a classroom. It is a structured guideline that presents and sets the standard for students and serves just like a contract between the instructor and the student. It is a tool that sets students up for success. 
	A well-designed syllabus establishes a connection between the teacher and the student. It describes course goals as well as goals made by the instructor. It paints a clear picture of what students can expect in their courses and project the future with an outline of class plans and homework plans. Students can use this to their advantage by learning how to prioritize time around classes and personal life, as well as, mastering self-management with themselves and assignments. 
	My syllabus for my jazz course this semester, by my professor, Bradley Williams, perfectly demonstrates what an exceptional syllabus should be as described in the first two paragraphs above. When first reading the syllabus, the information presented talks about the instructor’s contact information, where he will be located, and the times he will be available for office hours. It is important that the contact information is in the beginning because if, and whenever used, you know it is at the beginning of the syllabus. Not only this, but the course number as well and how many credits the course is worth is located in the beginning as well. Next, would be the course materials that you will need once attending the class. For example, it is useful to know that you will not have a required text for this course. This is important information because once a book has been bought you can not return it. Books are very expensive, so knowing this information, in the beginning, is useful before making any purchase of book material. 
	After this, he goes into talking about the policies, their requirements and how to meet them, also homework. First up is attendance; he explains how many days can be missed before being officially counted and how many until failed. Also the percent the attendance drops by each time a certain amount of days I missed. There is a certain material you will need named an Iclicker for use of attendance. This is necessary because it will be how your attendance is recorded and if do not have one you will be marked as absent. Late work is explained next and the percent that will be deducted depending on the days. 
Next is the student courtesy policy explaining that no electronic use is tolerated; show that the instructor would like you to not have any laptops, cellphones, etc. in the class because it is offensive to him. He would like us to focus more on the lesson he is teaching than being distracted by anything during class. Then is the academic integrity policy; it is about not cheating and being honest about your work if not followed it describes the consequences that it will lead to in the disciplinary policy. This information gives you more than enough reason to be honest about your work and how there are zero toleration. It is nice he has sections like religious holiday explaining if any day in your religion requires any absence of class just to communicate with him. Also, the disability accommodation section has information about what resources the college has to keep a barrier-free environment where all students are accommodated to be treated fairly and equally with any disability.
Leading to evaluation criteria homework section describing how and what homework will be administered throughout the semester. Having this helps keep an idea of what assignments are to come throughout time. Not only this but in this section also describes how much each assignment is worth; further explaining specifically how many quizzes, essays, and how performances are needed to be attended to in this class. He gives a description almost like a guide for the essays saying that there are questions to follow. In all this, it helps to have more of an understanding of all the assignment so it is less stressful, and a guideline to follow if ever necessary.
	Knowing we all know how nervous exams can make everyone this syllabus loosens those nerves. Midterm grades due dates are said and what material will be covered on those exams. Not only this but in the midterm section he explains the worth of those exams and what is and is not allowed; not just the midterm is explained but the final as well. Another big assignment is explained that is a big part of the class and that is the concert writing assignment. It is great and such a stress reliever that the syllabus is more like a guideline so that passing the class is easier. 
	In the ending of the syllabus he put a calendar of all the events that happen throughout the time of the course. Having a calendar is the best part of this syllabus because it is your schedule. It has all the dates highlighted that are important and have what is happening during that day. 
	Last but not least there are some side notes about where to find help in different areas of the college. It is nice to have something that not only helps you in your class course but as well throughout the college; helping you know the other resources available to you. These resources can further help you with the class and also in your other classes.
	A syllabus is your professor's way of communicating information on specific expectations, deadlines, and responsibilities. It is a helpful course planning tool that helps build solid rules and standards to follow while attending. This tool is a guide for success in this class for students. This syllabus sets the goal for you to meet and has a good intentions set behind it. If any teacher has a syllabus written for your class I highly recommend use it because you have a greater chance of receiving the highest grade possible in this course."
What Have I Learned?,"In the beginning of this class, I had difficulty with my ability to write, especially compared to others. I haven’t always been the best of the best when it came to any english class, regardless, I always did my best. I can say though that this class has helped me in ways other classes couldn’t. Taking this course has shown me in depth different ways to apply knowledge like how to word arguments, citations, analizations, and other helpful writing techniques that I am continuing to improve on. With everything I have learned and continued to apply, my writing has developed greatly from what it was before. 
	The first essay we were assigned, we were to about a point in our lives when we felt like an outsider. Whether that means you are in a new school, a new job, or feeling out of place because of your race, gender, and ethnicity. You had to further explain obstacles that you faced until you finally felt accepted and a part of that community. Finally, you also had to write what you learned from this new experience. The experience that I went through as an outsider, was when I moved to a new place and went to a new school. When writing this paper, I struggled with explaining the challenges that came with being so isolated. I also found myself constantly repeating points that I already spoke about. Additionally, I kept over thinking and second guessing what to write down. Once doing my rough draft and receiving my feedback I noticed a lot of my grammar issues and other  points that made my paper confusing. I took the comments and advice given when rewriting my assignment to make it better than it previously was. The prompt given was very easy to understand and it was a breeze to remember a story to discuss. Since the story line I was using recently occurred, it helped when I was trying to remember the details I needed to write an effective paper. Over time, I feel that I learned how to tell a story with a more in depth explanation. I learned how to make it feel as if the person was either having a conversation with me or experiencing the same thing themselves.
	After the first assignment, the next assignment topic was on analyzing a syllabus in one of your classes. We were instructed to describe the meaning of a syllabus and the purpose it serves. We were not only to highlight the purpose and significance of the syllabus, but also demonstrate your understanding and interpretation of the syllabus you chose. Being given this assignment, I think that the biggest challenge was to analyze what you were also summarizing. I found it difficult to have a distinction between the analyzation and explanation. I first summarized the syllabus, then I would take that summarization and describe it further by analyzation. I learned to first give a summary so that the audience had an understanding of what I was about to start deciphering. The easier part of this assignment was being able to choose any subjects syllabus to analyze. It helped because I was able to choose syllabus that was well described and had much to discuss. The syllabus I wrote about was fool proof in the sense that it answered any questions that you can possibly think. However, learning how to analyze something as simple as a syllabus helped me further understand its purpose. Having good analyzation skills can be applied in the real world by helping me gather the information I need to make wise decisions as well as get the most of something I don’t understand. From that assignment alone, I have more of an understanding between the difference of summarizing something versus taking something and analyzing it in further detail.  
	I had already learned some useful writing skills from the essays previously written, so when faced with our the third assignment I had much more confidence in my work. The third assignment was on a problem in your community and the solutions you can come up with to better the environment. The issues and solutions were to be addressed by a higher power and describe the problem in great detail. An important part of this assignment, is writing a cover letter to an entity introducing the problem, your solutions, and why you have chosen this particular entity to address. With this assignment, I found it difficult to make my solutions convincing to my audience. Along with making my solutions convincing, citing sources to back up my solutions being presented was another challenge. I found that when you have a source with a lot of evidence, helping and backing up my solution was much easier. It also helped with supporting my ideas, making my solutions more convincing. What actually came much easier, was coming up with the important issues in our community and the solutions that I wanted to use for the problem. The problem in itself,  gave me lots to discuss. Since my problem was on gun violence, there were many solutions to argue about on how they could resolve this problem. From this assignment, I learned how to apply citations to material, researching supporting details, and providing a strong persuasive argument behind something I believed in.  
	Overall, I feel that this course has helped me greatly improve my writing skills as well as my speaking skills. The assignments have strengthened my ability to write different prompts with more of an in depth explain, description, analyzation, and tone. I see that I am more confident once writing a paper, however, there is no doubt that I still need more work in improving my writing skills. Over time, I can see myself applying these skills throughout my classes in college, then, in my career. From where I was before, I believe it is a great start to a new beginning. In the future, I will be able to articulate myself better and be able to clearly explain things with ease. I have gained so much from this course and hope I am able to further use and improve my new skills.

Letter,"Dear Mr.Rush, 

        Throughout this semester I gained lots of knowledge and valuable skills on how to assemble the essays given to me when writing them. I have more of an understanding of the concepts that were taught to better my skill. I feel that with these new improved abilities I feel confident  in completing and taking the English 161 class  as well as other English classes throughout my time in college. With English 161, I was afraid that I would not be good enough for the class and would need lots of help constantly.  Now, I feel that I can conquer any challenges thrown my way with any assignment given without feeling like I need to ask someone for help. Before taking this class, I feel that I wasn’t ready for such work and difficulty, but now I feel fully prepared. Even though I know there are some areas I still  struggle with, it is nothing compared to what I was before. When writing this final paper, I will discuss the challenges I encountered when doing the assignment and what was smooth about it. For instance, with all the assignments written I noticed that grammar was also a problem and my use of words. Having the feedback from my rough drafts did help me alot when revising and learning from my mistakes. I learned a lot with each assignment given I feel that with each one I could further use that information for the next assignment and so on. My experience with this class and these assignment has helped me better myself and has helped lift my confidence. I gained so much also my experience with you has made english a lot more easier for me to handle. I definitely feel more prepared than before and am excited to see what's next for me to endure.

Research Synthesis Essay ,"The true meaning of the “American dream” changes in the eyes of many who have faced adversity or who are currently in the face of adversity. To some like Jennie Chu, author of “My American dream is green”, the American dream is to find your pursuit of happiness. On the other hand, Denene Millner’s “A New Black American Dream” suggests while in the midst of the fight of equality, African Americans share wealth within their communities and open our own businesses to give back to each other. Today, the American Dream is an evolving controversy from generation to generation.  
	In most foreign cultures, the idea of going to America is romanticized. The American dream was a holy grail, making America a place for second chances and having a shot at being the one who provides generational wealth to your family. “The American dream had been a myth for me throughout the 30 or so years that I'd lived in the United States. I couldn't fully grasp how the concept of ""the pursuit of happiness"" fit into a superbusy, superfast American life” (Chu 2019). Multiculturally, the American Dream was glorified to children while they were young to motivate them to find happiness in the social standards of American people: a well-paying job, a happy marriage, great children, and wealth. Many argue that wealth has nothing to do with happiness. In relation to the American dream, Jennie Chu uses Jefferson’s words to describe her newfound happiness. 
	Education is also in many people’s idea of the American dream. Parents are constantly pushing their children to attend prestigious schools to fit the image of a polished family name and many other glorified societal accomplishments. America’s working middle class have always been vulnerable to poverty. “My parents were middle class but vulnerable; a missed paycheck could lead to a missed mortgage payment, which could lead to the loss of their home, dropping them into poverty. Education and professional careers, they insisted, would save my brother and me from this fate. And they were right” (Miller 2018) Even in America, middle-class families have normalized heavily suggesting school and creating the idea of a good education promising wealth. 
	While Chu and Miller’s depiction of the American dream differs, they respond to each other by being mutually exclusive ideas about the meaning of the American Dream. Today, children are growing into an adapting society. Recently, traditional ways of doing many things are becoming outdated and replaced. Chu and Miller agree that the American Dream is a feeling of achievement. While Miller defines achievement as creating our own businesses that serve our community (Miller 2018), Chu feels that finding priceless satisfaction in your craft is her version of the American Dream. Both authors advocate a sense of ownership between their views while having differing perceptions of achievement. Achieving the American Dream is done by working for everything you have and getting far in life. 
	Today, the American Dream has evolved into our lifestyles. In their own way, everyone in the country is trying to achieve their version of the American Dream. The American Dream has been a progressing idea and it influenced younger generations by their parents. The term ""American Dream"" was apparently invented in 1931 by historian James Truslow Adams; he was referring to ""That dream of a land in which life should be better and richer and fuller for every man, with opportunity for each according to his ability or achievement” (Lewyn 2008). The statement is still relevant today. Within younger generations, the American Dream is what we are taught: “do good in school”, go to a reputable college, be smart with your money, have a good credit score (for the ability to finance), find a spouse, have kids, and teach them better. The American Dream can be anything, from someone’s motivation to better themselves, change, or save their lives. For parents, the American dream can be to guide your children to do the things you could have done in the past to have made your life better. To me, the American dream is to be successful in something that makes you happy.

Discussion 2,"In Kai-Fu Lee’s How AI Can Save Our Humanity, the technological revolution and its integration in human lives are highlighted in many ways. Lee introduced many powerful points on how artificial intelligence benefits our lives today, both negatively and positively. Today, the loss of jobs is globally a haunting issue. While AI continues to replace many white-collar jobs, Lee describes this as liberation for humans to live for the meaning of our existence, love (Lee 2018). Around the world, people are conditioned to feel that work is the reason for our existence. The loss of jobs due to AI causes the feeling that our lives on earth are useless, without work. Lee brings the glory of AI to our foreground, claiming that AI allows us to redefine the meaning of our lives and creativity. 
	The article, “Where machines could replace humans-- and where they can’t (yet)”, written by Michael Chui, James Manyika, and Mehdi Miremadi, provides a plethora of information about the benefits and disadvantages of automation. Automation is projected to replace the need for humans, in everyday life, and in jobs. However, automation has been paramount in societal growth. “Understanding the activities that are most susceptible to automation from a technical perspective could provide a unique opportunity to rethink how workers engage with their jobs and how digital labor platforms can better connect individuals, teams, and projects” (Chuey et al., 2016). With automation replacing simple jobs like food and beverage services, hospitality, retail, and financial services, complex jobs that require human uniqueness and creativity. 
	Today, the claims of Lee and Chuey et al are completely relevant. In everyday life, society has revolved around comfort and convenience. AI and automation have provided humans with products and services at the speed of light. In both articles, the technology revolution is depicted as a tool for society with substantial potential. While there are both pros and cons, AI and automation can be utilized to improve everyday life in all aspects. AI and automation can be thought of as liberation for humans, and an open door to a plethora of jobs that require uniqueness and creativity.

Stock Analysis,"Apple’s stock has considerably fluctuated in the last 10 years. After the release of every iPhone or Macbook computer, it’s stock price clearly reacted. Apply has now grown into the largest US company by market capitalization. It is traded on NASDAQ as AAPL. In 2007, Apple’s stock price was $11.94 in January. According to a report by Seth Archer (2017), Apple’s stock rose 31% since January and was reported to be $15.75 on June 26, 2007, the day the first iPhone was released.  In a month, the stock price was down by a full 7%. In 2008, the iPhone 3G was released and the stock rose 2% but fell by 1% a month later. Archer (2014) reported that in January of 2008, the stock price was $23.15 which is a 93.8% increase compared to last year. After a month from the release of the iPhone 3GS in 2009, Apple’s stock dropped by 4%. In 2011, the world heavily anticipated the iPhone 4s, a completely different design from the traditional thick and round iPhone 3GS. Apple stocks soared by 13%. In 2012, the iPhone 5 was unveiled causing a 3% increase to then plummet by a full 8%. 2011 was a year of major fluctuations for Apple’s stock prices. It had many big increases only to fall by a considerable amount rapidly after. Along with its major fluctuations, 2011 was the year that Apple CEO Steve Jobs also passed away, a day after the iPhone 4S unveiling. It is clear how external factors indirectly affect their internal factors. Competitors like Google, Samsung, and Dell did not see fluctuations as unpredictable and drastic as Apple. Internal factors definitely have a greater impact on the fluctuations mentioned above.

Overlearning Summary,"	Even when physically in the classroom learning a material doesn’t mean that you will retain the information for a long period of time. Though little is still known about the long-term effectiveness of most learning strategies. (Doug Rohrer, Harold Pashler 2007) They have conducted learning experiments where after a year of observation the subject is tested; focusing on the questions: when to switch to other material to study and how a fixed amount of time can be distributed within the study session? These are the questions Doug Rohrer and Harold Pashler were trying to answer so that when studying students can do so in a more effective and efficient manner.
	Once studying a material in an uninterrupted dedicated manner one must decide when it is best to stop and switch on to a new material. For example, when a student has been looking through the same vocabulary list, the student  must decide whether to cycle again through the same list (Doug Rohrer, Harold Pashler 2007). After having an error-free performance, getting what you're studying right, with continuation immediately after is known as overlearning (Doug Rohrer, Harold Pashler 2007). Overlearning, by many educators, is argued to be highly effective with boosting long-term retention. The subjects were tasked to come to a decision of either quitting or continuing the same material being studied. Overall overlearning increases performance for a little while, but then the benefit diminishes abruptly over time.  Overlearning can be useful in situations more short-term. It becomes un-useful in parts where you continue to study the same material, adding a smaller investment in return for study time.  When thinking about the space of learning you think about how the distribution of your study time affects learning. Studies show that performance is performed better if the study time is spaced rather than massed. Yet, it is also been recorded that sometimes too-brief of a gap causes a poorer performance than excessively long gaps. Examples can be shown in traditional school teachings now. 
 The studies so far have shown us that the subjects are required to learn concrete facts, bringing upon the question what the task requiring more abstract kinds of learning would generalize to. The learning of mathematics is generally learned by practicing problems immediately to practice another. Within each set that is being studied each are being varied, which may enhance the learning itself. With a shuffled format, students are required to choose the appropriate format to use for each problem. Thus creating an independent benefit to the spacing effect.  
The first study mentioned shows the test performance from subjects who chose to either quit or continue studying after a certain amount of studying. If continued the additional studying gave a boost to the test performance results. In a closer look, examination led to the find or the benefits to be short lived. In another experiment, studies showed that the longer you take a break in between switching leads to a more beneficial outcome. Subjects in elementary and middle school were tasked with spelling different vocabulary words every week, but it would be better if they were given the words monthly. Same at the college level, if given cumulative final exams it would induce the restudy of material. With a math experiment students were taught a task and then assigned more practice problems. The additional problems had no effect on the scores. Till taken by two different groups; one group separating their problems in two sessions with a week break. The other group who did their problems in one session scored lower than the group who spaced out their studies. These studies are all testing the most efficient ways to study while also showing the non beneficial ways. 
	Theory is that you could never study a paper enough or even have too much or little time spent spaced out in between. Although this article focused more on the ideal timing and time period, there are many more decisions that learners come to face; like the different ways to study. Should they see the answer first or later, should you study one part or all together; it is not just the timing of the studying that matters, it is the method you use as well. Which brings the question why they never considered the different methods when researching and recording experiments. The main idea is to focus on your time management and the method you use when studying and managing your time. Find what is best for you, what works with your schedule best, to help you succeed the most.
Applied Challenge 
I was always one to be struggling with time management in studying for my classes, especially with multiple classes that I am struggling with for grades at once.  On top of already pressed for time added to the pressure is the stress to do my best and negative thoughts in my head telling me how much I am unable to succeed. With being a college student, along with work, my schedule gets hectic and I'm always in a situation where I have limited time. So when it comes down to studying, especially material I’m not fully understanding, it is hard to learn everything by memory. Let alone for one class so multiple classes adds more to the table that makes it ever harder to give each subject the amount of time they need. Finding effective methods that are also efficient don’t always come easily. What works for one class may not work for the other. 
You’d think constantly studying the same material would help you memorize the material for the exam, yet studies have shown that this is not the case. I was one to constantly study material for an exam over and over thinking it would help me in the long run. Later to realize that it was only a short term memory that wouldn’t last. What I would do to improve my study habits is stop continuously going over material that I know and go over to the material that I don’t know. Multiple experiments have shown that when you continuously re-study material once having an error-free performance is known as overlearing. Which hurts your efforts to memorize material in the long run. Another new study habit that I will incorporate is studying my material in sets of days instead of all in the same day. Having a longer break in between material benefits you more than having a shorter break. With these new methods I will have a more efficient and effective system.

Assignment 3 ,"Technology has been heavily integrated in billions of children’s and adult’s lives today. These technological advances have been an ongoing transition and have been rapidly increasing over the modern age. As we develop technological advances to employ convenience in our everyday professional and personal lives, it is clear that this innovation is heavily beneficial, however, technology outstrips society’s ability to adapt. This modern age of advancement has heavily threatened traditional ways of regulating businesses and industries, as well as affecting the development of our children of today. Government regulation should be more involved with technological advancement to protect our environment, as well as consumers and workers. 
Before the transition towards the modern age, children would spend time outdoors and creating relationships with fellow children that they spent outdoors with. They utilized their imagination and creativity. In most households, families would spend dinner building a deeper connection with each other over dinner or even at the couch utilizing quality time to play board games or interact. The amount of time we spend replacing human interaction with technological interaction is dangerous. This promotes a sedentary lifestyle and can influence children who have a vulnerable mindset. Child obesity is at an all time high and causally linked to technology overuse.  Most programs on the television are designed for people to consume by tailoring ads for the specific people watching. For example, an ad for a toy would show up while children are watching an age appropriate channel, to influence their parents to buy the toy, thus, stimulating the economy. “A 2010 Kaiser Foundation study showed that elementary aged children use on average 7.5 hours per day of entertainment technology, 75 percent of these children have TV's in their bedrooms, and 50 percent of North American homes have the TV on all day.” (Rowan) The amount of hours a child spends occupying their time into entertainment technology can be greatly detrimental to a child’s health. The four critical factors necessary to achieve a sustainable lifestyle are movement, touch, human connection, and exposure to nature. With the use of technology, a cell phone, and the internet, a child lacks all four critical factors to achieve a sustainable lifestyle and the right type of development. With regulation, you can ensure that citizens will be protected no matter what age. Such government regulation on the web would filter harmful content that children can be exposed to, as well as stronger parental controls on how much time a child could be spending on the internet. “Diagnoses of ADHD, autism, coordination disorder, developmental delays, unintelligible speech, learning difficulties, sensory processing disorder, anxiety, depression, and sleep disorders are associated with technology overuse, and are increasing at an alarming rate.” (Rowan) Our everyday lives are affected and absorbed by the new ways of life that technology brings upon us, however, it’s clear that society needs an effective method to control a number of aspects that affect children of today. With an increase of use of television, internet, video games and etc, it hinders self regulation and attention skills needed for learning. Some research is also linked to a number of behavioural problems as well as sensory imbalances that can be developed from prolonged use. Our biology has not evolved  to accommodate this lifestyle. 
There are a number of effects that prolonged technology use that can be harmful to a developing child or even a preteen. “Obesity is higher today, due to excessive technology use.  More children are diagnosed with ADHD than ever before.” (Rodes) For example, when a child is constantly plugged into a video game that consists of heavy violence, they are stressed. The mind and body does not know the difference between whether the situation or feeling is real or not. They don’t give their bodies time to relax or unwind. This can also apply to teens who are constantly checking their devices, stripping their bodies of being able to relax. Using technology at night can make you lose sleep and go hand in hand to adding stress. Eventually, “this can develop an addiction with the pattern of constantly checking your devices.” (Rodes) With constantly checking phones or playing video games, you can develop a higher sense of loneliness and depression. You can also eventually become disassociated by isolating yourself with the amount of time you spend with technology overuse and start to lose the ability to communicate effectively. Lack of social interaction and communication can cause incivility and strip you of your self awareness. “You can develop insecurity and anxiety by comparing yourself to others.” (Rodes) Alongside mental effects caused by technology overuse, children are more prone to danger with prolonged use of the internet. With the ability to access a world of resources and social networking sites, vulnerable children face being a target for sexual predators, as well as predators who obtain private information online. More and more children and teens own one or more technological device where they can get online without adult supervision. While websites allow everyone a platform to freely express their ideas, a child’s safety is compromised the exposure to hate speeches, false information, terrorist propaganda, adult content, and etc. Today, websites are accountable for the safety of their users’. Regulation would bring on a more standardized approach to filter the distribution of harmful content and measure companies against those standards. Regulation could set baselines for what is prohibited and require companies to build systems for keeping harmful content to a bare minimum. 
	Regulators today are concerned about how social media is aggravating poor mental health. There are many risks that children could encounter with unsupervised technological use. These risks include impacted sleep, poor body image, bullying, unwelcome sexual content and grooming. These issues are constantly reignited by the amount of suicide and self harm related to cyberbullying. “Current research suggests that suicide ideation and attempts among adolescents have nearly doubled since 2008, making suicide is the second leading cause of death for individuals 10-34 years of age.” (Meier) The negative impacts of social media in young users are becoming one of the biggest concerns in society today. Younger users’ safety is compromised causing younger users to feel isolated. Kids in school today are experiencing more and more discriminating violence. “6% of students had been threatened or injured with a weapon on school property one or more times and about 4% of students ages 12–18 reported that they had been afraid of attack or harm at school during the school year.” (Meier) At the moment, if bad things happen, there is currently no recourse or legal accountability for these social media companies or other websites that younger users are exposed to that are potentially harmful. Self regulation will no longer suffice with the rapid growth and advancement of the internet and technology today. “Cyberbullying is a massive issue for young people. Reports suggest 50% to 80% of school-age children have experienced it in some form, 25% repeatedly, and well over half don’t tell their parents.” (McVeigh) With a strong enforcement of the government on regulation, a standard foundation for all websites to follow can be a stepping stone in protecting the children of today for generations to come. It is imperative that we protect young people online as much as we do offline. Today, companies are failing to share data in order to carry out studies on behaviour that could contribute to evidence-based findings on the impacts of the safety of our young people on the web. This must include an independent statutory regulator with enforcement powers that can impose strong sanctions on platforms that fail to keep children safe. Government regulation of these social media websites could also mean better utilization of data and evidence need to take action on suicide cases. 
	Digital exposure is becoming a large part of young people’s lives. Younger generation users, despite parental controls can easily fall into the wrong links with how a multitude of websites and advertisements are using something called “clickbait” to divert the attention of users on their websites. Those websites include a superfluity of mature and “NSFW”content and can easily influence a younger users’ developing maturity.  This generation of users have a growing exposure to the world around us with access to the internet. The internet expands social, political, and economic activities of today’s people across the entire world, however, with this tool, our youth can get access to areas of interest and can easily be negatively influenced, and also heavily misinformed by the distractions and inaccuracy of what they see on the internet. This clearly promotes harmful content to vulnerable people. While we adapt to technology being a huge part of our everyday lives, younger users are losing the ability to effectively communicate with people. “We are more detached due to technology, and especially young children who use technology. It is just too soon and too young without developing their social skills. We are more isolated and, yes, stressed because of this constant need to stay connected.” (Mcveigh) This generation is now born accustomed to navigating technology, while parents use technological devices to entertain babies and toddlers for the convenience and time to do other things. Those babies and toddlers soon have difficulty with their memory, social and emotional development, as well as face to face communication. “While going through all these changes, both in the outside world and physically inside, technology use can affect your mental wellbeing.  It can also affect your dynamics in school, with friends, and eventual romantic relationships.” (Rodes) Government regulation would be a stepping stone, in tackling some of the issues creating something that could spot cyberbullying and harmful content and timing out younger users. 
	Apart from protecting our youth, government regulation on technology could heavily benefit an entire market of technological companies, and even privately owned businesses. While being a platform for entrepreneurs to flourish, there is a privacy issue on information stored during operations. Users must continue to trust that their personal information will be secure and their privacy protected. The total cost of data breaches are enormous. We need clear rules on when information can be used to serve the public interest and how it should apply to new technologies such as artificial intelligence. “A 2014 study estimated that the aggregate annual data breach-specific cost to the U.S. economy was $140 billion (including direct costs to businesses, indirect costs to their customers, and indirect law enforcement-related costs), and that 500,000 jobs a year were lost due to such breaches.” (Abbott) Citizens can be better protected by regulation, by having transparency in companies and how they work. Regulation can restore accountability and build trust in tech. It will be an effective motion that brings us closer to making the conversation about the uses and abuses of technology more public.  “According to the U.S. Justice Department’s Bureau of Justice Statistics, “an estimated 17.6 million Americans—about 7% of U.S. residents age 16 or older—were victims of identity theft in 2014.” (Abbott) Effective privacy and data protection needs a globally harmonized framework.The internet itself is a frictionless information free-market. Without regulation, internet service providers and companies, whether they are privately owned or a large corporation, could in theory block access to content they don't want you to see, like a rival video streaming site or another site that competes with their own interests, or even content they deem as unsuitable. Regulation allows fair representation and would promote innovation and competition amongst each other.  
 Finally, the importance of government regulation of technology and devices sold is clear. It would guarantee a solution to a younger user’s current issues on the overuse of technology. It would protect citizens of today by a promising remedy on how to protect personal information. It would standardize a framework that would harmonize how privately owned businesses and large companies’ operations are performed. It would protect vulnerable children from harmful content. Regulation is additionally important to promote healthier lifestyles in developing children. We would help create a safe and healthy environment for younger user’s online by regulation as well as minimize use entirely.

Essay Yellow,"How does “The Yellow Wallpaper” represent the different issues of traditional gender-role marriages and postpartum depression and mental illness in women? “The Yellow Wallpaper” addresses traditional patriarchal marriage and postpartum depression with themes of possession and projection with the symbolism of Jane and the wallpaper in their house. The narrator of the story is a woman married to a reputable doctor. Throughout the text, she struggles with her husband’s passive demeanor of possessiveness while projecting her mental illness on the horrid yellow wallpaper of the nursery room. As she mentions her issues with her husband, he constantly dismisses her by telling her to rest and calling her issues a nervous weakness. 
The first part of the text heavily highlights the themes of possession, by showing John’s strict authority over Jane. They moved into a large estate on her account, solely to have all the rest and air that Jane, the narrator could get. She was placed in the room at the top of the house which used to be a nursery for the previous owners. There was nothing wrong with the room except for the yellow wallpaper. “The paint and paper look as if a boys’ school had used it. It is stripped off—the paper—in great patches all around the head of the bed, about as far as I can reach, and in a great place on the other side of the room low down. I never saw a worse paper in my life.” (Stetson) Thus, the insanity began. As she tries to address her dislike to John, her husband, he passively reiterates that they are only renting the space, and that there is no reason to get worked up about something as little as the yellow wallpaper. “‘But John says if I feel so, I shall neglect proper self-control; so I take pains to control myself-before him, at least, and that makes me very tired.” (Stetson) There is a sign of both projection and possession in this quote by displaying John’s authority. He strongly projects his “disciplined” self image and point of view on her life, therefore controlling her even more.  His authority is so powerful that it starts to control how she thinks. “He says that with my imaginative power and habit of story-making, a nervous weakness like mine is sure to lead to all manner of excited fancies, and that I ought to use my will and good sense to check the tendency. So I try.” (Stetson) The text is in the narrator’s point of view, as she expresses herself through her writing. John, thinks that her writing is part of her exhaustion but she needs activity and stimulation as an outlet. “There comes John, and I must put this away, - he hates to have me write a word.” (Stetson) When John tells her that she hates for her to write, in other words, he hates for her to be herself. Throughout the text, she justifies his emotional abuse and manipulation by reiterating his love and concern for her and her health. “At first he meant to repaper the room, but afterwards he said that I was letting it get the better of me, and that nothing was worse for a nervous patient than to give way to such fancies.” (Stetson) He belittles her into the title of a “patient” when addressing her concerns. Jennie is John’s sister, who also serves as a housekeeper for the couple. As John speaks with Jennie about the narrator, Jane, he causes Jennie to police Jane as well on what she can and cannot do while healing from her “nervous weakness”. “I must not let her find me writing. “ (Stetson) At this point, the narrator’s mental health starts to exhaust her greatly. It is almost as if she is living a double life, and her voice can never be heard. “I don't feel as if it was worthwhile to turn my hand over for anything, and I'm getting dreadfully fretful and querulous. I cry at nothing, and cry most of the time. Of course I don't when John is here, or anybody else, but when I am alone.” (Stetson) It is easy to tell that she begins to feel disassociated and restless. John’s possession over Jane grows deeper into the text. But again, Jane reminds herself that John loves her and is overprotective because of it. However, everytime she tries to discuss her issues she is never heard. “Dear John! He loves me very dearly and hates to have me sick. I tried to have a real earnest reasonable talk with. him the other day, and tell him how I wish he would let me go and make a visit to Cousin Henry and Julia. But he said I wasn't able to go, nor"" able to stand it after I got there and I did not make out a very good case for myself, for I was crying before I had finished.” (Stetson) Her weakness increases mentally, emotionally, and physically, causing her to second guess even trying to bring up how she feels to her husband and ending up in tears. “It is so hard to talk with John about my case, because he is so wise, and be­cause he loves me so.” (Stetson) She constantly reminds herself that he loves her, to respect him and keep sane. “I am glad my case is not serious! But these nervous troubles are dreadfully depressing. John does not know how much I really suffer. He knows there is no reason to suffer, and that satisfies him.” (Stetson) John has a passive, stern way about him with Jane but whatever he says goes. He seems that he only sees things in his perspective and strongly wishes his wife to see things the same. John remains comfortable in his privilege and dominance while Jane has to uncomfortably swallow her pride and adapt emotionally.
While the first half of the text introduces the themes of possession by showcasing Jane’s silent voice with her husband John, the second half of the text introduces Jane’s projection. She channels her emotions from the situation at hand with John, into the yellow wallpaper that irks her. “I start, we’ll say, at the bottom, down in the corner over there where it has not been touched, and I determine for the thousandth time that I will follow that pointless pattern to some sort of conclusion.” (Stetson) As Jane lays in bed, she is sleepless and restless. John’s lack of consideration for Jane makes her project her feelings onto her surroundings, in bed staring at the yellow wallpaper. The more Jane stares at the paper the more she starts to relate closely to herself. “There is one marked peculiarity about this paper, a thing nobody seems to notice but myself, and that is that it changes as the light changes.” (Stetson) The narrator elaborates how Jane stays quiet during the day, hiding and resting from John and Jennie. Jane talks about how she even acts asleep during the evening, but spends all night studying the paper. “I didn't realize for a long time what the thing was that showed behind, that dim sub-pattern, but now I am quite sure it is a woman. By daylight she is subdued, quiet. I fancy it is the pattern that keeps her so still. It is so puzzling. It keeps me quiet by the hour.” (Stetson) As her insanity increases, she starts to make out figures in the wallpaper, speaking about how she starts to see a trapped woman who only comes out at night. It is a subtle but clear relation to Jane as you can see that she feels trapped in the house “resting” all day hiding herself from John and Jennie but by night, she feels somewhat free. Jane becomes entirely obsessed with the wallpaper. “There are things in that paper which nobody knows but me, or ever will.  Behind that outside pattern the dim shapes get clearer every day. It is always the same shape, only very numerous. And it is like a woman stooping down and creeping about behind that pattern. I don’t like it a bit. I wonder—I begin to think—I wish John would take me away from here!” (Stetson) She experiences a sense of fear thinking that she saw a woman creeping, but in reality, the thought of her creeping around, hiding herself scares her. She internalizes his authority completely that she now fears thinking against him. Jane begins to think that even Jennie and John are onto the wallpaper, in translation, that they are onto her seeking freedom. On the last day of being in the house, Jane plans to free the woman, herself. She locked herself in the room and threw away the key and is completely delusional, to the point where she bites off a piece of the wallpaper in anger. “Sometimes I think there are a great many women behind, and sometimes; only  one, and she crawls around fast, and her crawling shakes it all over. Then in the very ' bright spots she keeps still, and in the very shady spots she just takes hold of the bars and shakes them hard. And she is all the time trying to climb through. But nobody could climb through that pattern - it strangles so; I think that is why it has so many heads. They get through, and then the pattern strangles them off and turns them upside down, and makes their eyes white! If those heads were covered or taken off it would not be half so bad.” (Stetson) When Jane tears off the piece of the wallpaper, she mentions the strangled heads screaming in mockery of her. She has a hidden rope to climb “out. Jane gets angry and desperate to escape, an effect of her madness and depression. “I don't like to look out of the windows even - there are so many of those creeping women, and they creep so fast. I wonder if they all come out of that wallpaper as I did?” Jane leaves this question for readers to ponder, as if she asking if other women struggled as she did in her marriage. Jane has taken a huge emotional toll trying to keep her inner self inside. She constantly suppresses emotion, leading her to insanity. 
In the final analysis, the themes of projection and possession present themselves by Jane’s authoritative husband and Jane’s suppression of her emotions into the yellow wallpaper. The tearing of the wallpaper symbolizes the full connection that the woman in the wallpaper is Jane herself. The two women, Jane and the wallpaper woman, become one, and Jane is finally free.

The Congo Rainforest,"All around the world are numerous ecosystems that animals call home. They have learned to live, breed, and feed in those areas to keep their inhabitants alive for generations to come. In different atmospheres of the world temperatures can reach below freezing and above boiling, which determine what organisms will inhabit those areas and what species will be able to acclimate to each environment. Rainforests, like the Congo, have hot and humid atmospheres which generate an abundance of freshwater, shelter of course, resources and minerals that are vital to its inhabitants. The warm and wet environment creates a perfect living habitat for many plants and animals with its abundance of natural resources necessary for the survival of life. Among plants and animals, the Congo rainforest also is home to many Indigenous People. Most inhabitants of the Congo, whether they are animals, humans, or plants are actually unique to its region which makes the Congo that much more important to preserve. 
The Congo is the world's second largest tropical rainforest, making up more than 500 million acres of the African continent and the Earth’s land. The rainforest inhibits more than 250 different species including many of which are now critically endangered species. Since humans have discovered the Congo, many have seen it more as a monetary opportunity for urban life and resources rather than something precious to preserve. Deforestation rates have been exceeding significantly and has already exhausted and affected up to a million acres by the years (Gargasson et al., 1970). Deforestation not only affects the homes and environment of the organisms that inhabit them but also the Earth's atmosphere (Gargasson et al., 1970).  Leading to the Congo having less rain and oxygen, adding to the problem of global warming. While deforestation occurs, the amount of plants that can produce oxygen to combat CO2 levels decreases which greatly affect the Earth’s climate, the Ozone layer, our oxygen levels and much more. 
The animals that live in the Congo are not only threatened by deforestation but also things like poaching, or “land grabbing”. The term “land grabbing” actually is a name for a trend.. The trend, mentioned as “land grabbing” is the act of buying or leasing large areas of land in Africa to extract resources. “Land grabbing” actually earned its name due to the volume of land being bought in such a short amount of time. Poachers are those who hunt illegally, whether it be to sell for some quick cash or to eat! Many poachers want to kill endangered species for a generous bounty, and are most likely trading it in illegal markets and under the table operations. Unfortunately, poaching is one of the main reasons why many wild life goes extinct quickly, after being exploited. While poachers endanger wildlife, there are predators who endanger the land within the Congo. Without the Congo many of the animals you see at the zoo would no longer exist and the Earth’s carbon dioxide rate would increase significantly without the filtration of the trees its rainforest provides.
Additionally, during the pandemic the rate of deforestation has significantly increased in many ways. It’s a no-brainer that the pandemic increased the demand for natural resources and when many are forced to stay inside, wear masks, and essentially integrate to a completely virtual lifestyle. Masks alone require a hefty amount of trees and paper, protecting us humans but endangering the world around us. Another concrete example of over-exhausting resources are the Amazon warehouses and factories that are being built on every corner made for “no contact shopping”. While this promotes social distancing, the company requires many natural resources for production of products and services. The demand for a more virtual and socially distanced way of life can end up hurting our Earth.
 While deforestation essentially warms the climate, the many inhabitants of the Congo rainforest are hard at work. We know plants and animals are the main residents, but there are also viruses, pathogens, and parasites present that thrive in warmer climates. In addition to COVID, outbreaks like Ebola or the Lassa Fever throughout the Congo were prominent as well. Local and neighboring lands are continuously at risk of infection. 
As we all know the Congo provides an enormous home for many different organisms allowing them to flourish. The Congo not only provides a home to animals but also many different services to humans. The abundance of rich natural resources in the rainforests has enabled us to assist many in different ways like shelter, aid, food, water. Those people who live nearby gather basic necessities to thrive and also heal when sick (Gargasson et al., 1970). Many of the native people use the different plants as medicine for their ill loved ones. The Congo is also a producer of cobalt, copper, petroleum, and diamonds. If used effectively the Congo has the potential to help the continent of Africa out of poverty. The resources this rainforest has is endless to beneficial use but limited when not. 
Within the Congo rainforest is one big cycle used and maintained by the organism unitizing it. Like the cycle of life the land provides a habitat for animals and food/water to consume and maintain a healthy body to be able to reproduce. Like in all ecosystems there are prey and predators, but in the Congo predators you would see are gorillas, lions, cheetahs, leopards, etcs: which are more dangerous than the regular animals we have in America (Gargasson et al., 1970). The ecosystem also provides animals with protection like camouflage or a way of escape. The interaction between those that inhibit the Congo and the Congo itself is mostly mutual benefit. Yet, when it comes to the outsiders tearing the land down for urbanization and killing the animals for the gain of personal benefit the Congo weakens.
The Congo rainforest isn’t just like any regular rainforest it is a massive land sanctuary for many trying to live and thrive off the natural resources it provides. Not just the animales but the people who live there as well. Deforestation and poaching is affecting the rainforest at an alarming rate. With no tree being planted to replace the burnt torn down ones animals and plant life is slowly dying away. It is up to us to save our wildlife and our Earth. Without the Congo not even the air we breathe would be the same and our Earth would have a bigger global warming problem than before.

Crisis or Commitment,"The way that I grew up was pretty unconventional and I like to think that I have a strong sense of self-awareness because of that.  I express my identity to others through things like my career, my relationships, and my religious views. I learned to adapt really quickly in different environments because I moved around a lot due to my mom and dad being in the military. Every few years meant a different home and a different school, and you could say that it even was a new life. Having to move away to an entirely new place and then to another, can heavily affect the trajectory of your identity development. The things that I went through and have seen throughout my life play a big part in who I am today, even the people around me in their own journey of finding themselves with their own experiences. It is hard to feed off one another when we are all growing to understand who we are individually as people.  Just like my mom used to say, I am the best and worst parts of my mom and dad. When you apply that to your life, I feel like you can say that you are the product of the best and worst of all the things around you. 
There are four statuses of identity, also known as the four categories of “adolescent development” which are achievement, moratorium, foreclosure, and diffusion. These four categories of development are based on developmental psychologist James Marcia’s ideologies, theories and research. People who fall under “identity achievement” tend to be very sure of themselves, know their purpose and what they want. Those categorized under “moratorium” are those who are not entirely sure of their paths but still make an active effort to find their purpose. “Identity foreclosure” occurs when you have made a commitment to an identity without weighing out options or based on your environment and common way of life. “Identity diffusion” is when you haven’t made any commitment to an identity and are not working to form one (as cited in Feldman, 2017). 
Throughout all the places I lived, I have created solid friendships and have also lost some. It became difficult to differentiate authentic relationships between ingenuity and as a result, I lost a lot of time. I feel as if I wasted that time, exploring and moving around through different groups of friends that clearly did not compliment my identity. “Identity diffusion” was a repeating theme throughout my personal relationships. Identity diffusion categorizes “people who neither explore nor commit to considering various alternatives” (as cited in Feldman, 2017). While this sounds like this could be a negative thing, I found that this period of time in my life was actually imperative to how I maneuver throughout my relationships today. At the time, I was not aware that I was going through identity diffusion. Identity diffusion to me and my experience is highlighted all in how I never stayed committed to any one friend group. Once I started to work and started to go to college, I learned about my past self and helped me refine my present self, into my best self. 
Even though I have lived in multiple places besides Chicago like Virginia, South Carolina, California, and even Arizona I still never lost interest in the things that are very prominent in my life today. Going as far as taking a CNA class in highschool to get a head start in the career I would love to pursue in my future. Ever since I was very young, I knew in my heart I wanted to get a job as a nurse or a doctor from being around elderly people for most of the time. I was always coming back to Chicago because the rest of my family was there. My grandma always lived with us throughout my whole life. Because I was an only child from my mom, I had to learn how to be responsible quickly. Just like how I had to learn how to adapt. My grandparents have many siblings, so I have many great aunts and uncles to see when it comes around to the holidays! In highschool, I started a program that was going to help me pursue and finish my degree in becoming a nurse. To me, this period of my life was an ongoing period of commitment. While my life around me made its changes, I stayed grounded and true to my identity. Marcia classified teens who are within the “identity achievement” status as beings who successfully explored and are able to sort out their life and figure out their life’s purpose (as cited in Feldman, 2017).
In contrast to my period identity diffusion,  I like to think I kept a healthy balance of emotional intelligence throughout my experiences with places and people. Identity achievement can also look like someone who played football all through high-school and decided that playing basketball was a better fit, or someone who was majoring in computers and felt that majoring in writing was more suitable instead. 
Marcia highlighted that it was “important that adolescents are not necessarily stuck in one of the four categories of adolescent development” and that some move back and forth between moratorium and achievement also recognized as “MAMA” (as cited in Feldman, 2017).
It seems as though during your time here on earth, you may find yourself in all four statuses of identity. I’ve found myself in the moratorium status quite often throughout my timeline of emotional development, for example, when I decided to not commit to a religious preference and wait on what I truly wanted in my religious beliefs. On my mom’s side of the family are Catholics, and my dad’s side of the family are mostly Christian or Jahova’s witness. At least in moratorium, you are still trying to make an effort to commit to an identity and in contrast with diffusion, you don’t have a specific path or way to take or make one. In the past, I was influenced by friends and family and their religious beliefs and I was curious to see what I really wanted for myself in terms of religion. I wasn’t as devoted to my religion back then as I am today. Today, I am present and content with my identity. The journey to finding yourself is never ending for anyone.

How Does AI Technology Affect the World Today?,"Artificial Intelligence Technology has been heavily integrated into billions of children’s and adult’s lives today. These technological advances have been an ongoing transition and have been rapidly increasing over the modern age. As we develop technological advances such as artificial intelligence, to employ convenience in our everyday professional and personal lives, it is clear that this innovation is heavily beneficial.  However, technology outstrips society’s ability to adapt. This modern age of advancement has heavily threatened traditional ways of regulating businesses and industries, as well as affecting the development of our children of today. It has also replaced a number of jobs with machine learning while replacing human interaction. Government regulation should be more involved with technological advancement to protect our environment, as well as consumers and workers. 
Before the transition towards the modern age, children would spend time outdoors and create relationships with fellow children.  They utilized their imagination and creativity. In most households, families would spend dinner building a deeper connection with each other over dinner or even at the couch utilizing quality time to play board games or interact. The amount of time we spend replacing human interaction with interaction using artificial technology  is dangerous. This promotes a sedentary lifestyle and can influence children who have a vulnerable mindset. Child obesity is at an all-time high and causally linked to technology overuse. “A 2010 Kaiser Foundation study showed that elementary aged children use on average 7.5 hours per day of entertainment technology, 75 percent of these children have TV's in their bedrooms, and 50 percent of North American homes have the TV on all day.” (Rowan) The amount of hours a child spends occupying their time into artificial intelligence technology can be greatly detrimental to a child’s health. The four critical factors necessary to achieve a sustainable lifestyle are movement, touch, human connection, and exposure to nature. Artificial Intelligence can be used as a computerised companion, causing children to be dependent on this type of interaction. With the use of different artificial intelligence technologies, a cell phone, and the internet, a child lacks all four critical factors to achieve a sustainable lifestyle and the right type of development. With regulation, you can ensure that citizens will be protected no matter what age. Such government regulation on these technologies would filter harmful content that children can be exposed to, as well as enable stronger parental controls on how much time a child could be spending on the internet. “Diagnoses of ADHD, autism, coordination disorder, developmental delays, unintelligible speech, learning difficulties, sensory processing disorder, anxiety, depression, and sleep disorders are associated with technology overuse, and are increasing at an alarming rate.” (Rowan) Our everyday lives are affected and absorbed by the new ways of life that artificial intelligence technology brings upon us, however, it’s clear that society needs an effective method to control a number of aspects that affect children of today. With an increase in the use of artificial intelligence technology, it hinders self-regulation and attention skills needed for learning. Some research is also linked to a number of behavioral problems as well as sensory imbalances that can be developed from prolonged use. Our human physiology is not adapted to live a lifestyle of limited movement as well as a lack of human interaction, which is why we should be very cautious with these new and emerging technologies.   
	Regulators today are concerned about how social media is aggravating poor mental health. However, the current amount of regulation is not sufficient enough to protect consumer  health and wellbeing.  There are many risks that children could encounter with unsupervised technological use as well as prolonged use of different artificial technology interfaces. These risks include impacted sleep, poor body image, bullying, and unwelcome sexual content. These issues are constantly reignited by the amount of suicide and self-harm related to cyberbullying thus “current research suggests that suicide ideation and attempts among adolescents have nearly doubled since 2008, making suicide the second leading cause of death for individuals 10-34 years of age.” (Meier) The negative impacts of social media in young users are becoming one of the biggest concerns in society today. Younger users’ safety is compromised causing younger users to feel isolated. Kids in school today are experiencing more and more discriminating violence. “6% of students had been threatened or injured with a weapon on school property one or more times and about 4% of students ages 12–18 reported that they had been afraid of attack or harm at school during the school year.” (Meier) At the moment, if bad things happen, there is currently no recourse or legal accountability for these social media companies or other websites that younger users are exposed to that are potentially harmful. Self-regulation will no longer suffice with the rapid growth and advancement of the internet and technology today. “Cyberbullying is a massive issue for young people. Reports suggest 50% to 80% of school-age children have experienced it in some form, 25% repeatedly, and well over half don’t tell their parents.” (McVeigh) 
	Digital exposure is becoming a large part of young people’s lives. Younger generation users, despite parental controls, can easily fall into the wrong links with how a multitude of websites and advertisements are using something called “clickbait” to divert the attention of users on their websites. Those websites include a superfluity of mature and “NSFW” content and can easily influence a younger users’ developing maturity. This generation of users have a growing exposure to the world around us with access to the internet. The internet expands social, political, and economic activities of today’s people across the entire world.  However, with this tool, our youth can get access to areas of interest and can easily be negatively influenced, and also heavily misinformed by the distractions and inaccuracy of what they see on the internet. This clearly promotes harmful content to vulnerable people. While we adapt to AI technology being a huge part of our everyday lives, younger users are losing the ability to effectively communicate with people. “We are more detached due to technology, and especially young children who use technology. It is just too soon and too young without developing their social skills. We are more isolated and, yes, stressed because of this constant need to stay connected,” (Mcveigh).  This generation is now born accustomed to navigating AI technology, while parents use technological devices, or computerised companions to entertain babies and toddlers for the convenience and time to do other things. Those babies and toddlers soon have difficulty with their memory, social and emotional development, as well as face to face communication.
	On the contrary, Artificial Intelligence has been absolutely beneficial to big businesses of today. Companies are now more competitive than ever due to the utilization of AI technology.  AI technology has already replaced a number of jobs that require a human by being able to accomplish a plethora of tasks at the speed of light. AI technology allows customer service to be more personalized and better than ever before. “By combining historical customer service data, natural language processing, and algorithms that continuously learn from interactions, customers can ask questions and get high-quality answers.” (Elliot) AI technology also provides employers the convenience of being able to quickly select candidates. “Software quickly sifts through thousands of job applications and shortlists candidates who have the credentials that are most likely to achieve success at the company.” (Elliot) AI technology also can adapt over time to detect fraud. Just like AI tech can learn algorithms to personalize and tailor customer service, it can learn algorithms detect fraud. “By building models based on historical transactions, social network information, and other external sources of data, machine learning algorithms can use pattern recognition to spot anomalies, exceptions, and outliers. This helps detect and prevent fraudulent transactions in real time, even for previously unknown types of fraud.” (Elliot, Noga, Wellers) Machine learning with AI technology will inevitably be the future of businesses today. One troubling concern with AI technology in businesses today can be the prediction of replacing a multitude of jobs. “Only the ones that are looking for new creative ways to stay relevant, develop a skill or skills that will take machines a few decades to acquire and make the change now, not by natural selection but rather by forced evolution will be able to survive, evolve and thrive” (Canuma) It would take a long time for all jobs to be completely replaced in the workplace, but it is worrying how AI technology has been implemented in almost every big businesses of today. For example, if you go into a newly renovated Mcdonald’s, you can see large screens where you can place your own order instead of talking to someone at the cash register. You can customize your order, and even pay without having to speak to someone in real life. When you look at the cash register, you see that it is empty, and only tended to if someone needs to pick up their order or if they have an inquiry about something that the machines up front cannot handle. Even in every major grocery store today, you have self check-outs. The self checkout machines even speak to you with regular human greetings. You will only run into human interaction if there was something that needed approval to be voided or a pricing issue. Slowly, you can see how automation is implemented in our everyday lives by allowing time for employees to spend more time on other important tasks. The interaction among the machine is based on a specific algorithm. When the user deviates from the normal course of use it causes an error in the machine’s process.  If a potential customer does something slightly different than the usual course of action expected by the machine, it will most likely cause an error offsetting any potential benefits of increased efficiency.    
	Collectively, a fear has risen about AI technology in everyday life. “A popular understanding of AI is that it will enable a computer to think like a person. Others use the term to refer to computers that use algorithms to process large amounts of information and draw conclusions and learn from their experiences.” (Etzioni) It is projected that we are on are way to creating machines that will be much more intelligent and capable than human beings. A smart-phone is called a smart-phone for a reason, right? For example, social media is already buzzing with numerous people claiming how scary it is when they open an application on their phone only to find ads on things that they were just talking about. Other instances include using Uber, Lyft, Google or Apple Maps and their ability to understand that wherever you are going is your school, your job, your home, or a friends house. “Such extreme intelligences could not easily be controlled (either by the groups creating them, or by some international regulatory regime)…the intelligence will be driven to construct a world without humans or without meaningful features of human existence. This makes extremely intelligent AIs a unique risk, in that extinction is more likely than lesser impacts.” (Etzioni) On a brighter note, we are actively seeking solutions to ease this concern. “Musk wants us to start talking about what we do with AI. To that end, he’s donated $10 million to the Future of Life Institute to study ways to make sure AI is beneficial to humanity. Google, too, has set up an ethics board to keep an eye on its AI work.” (Maney) 
	Finally, the implementation of AI technology has been a stepping stone of advancement in various environments. AI technology has implemented efficiency and convenience in our everyday lives. There are a number of ways that it can be detrimental to our society but also a number of ways how it benefits our world today. Children of today continue to be challenged by the dangers and effects of AI technology. Jobs continue to be replaced by automation.  However, if we learn how to use AI technology in moderation and with regulation, our society would be more prosperous than ever before. 	"
Why is Emotional Intelligence Important?,"In our daily lives, we are constantly being perceived a certain way in different environments. We are continuously adapting to people and objects. In doing so, subconsciously, we are managing our ability to understand and manage our emotions to effectively communicate and maintain personal relationships. By the dictionary definition, emotional intelligence is “ the capacity to be aware of, control, and express one's emotions, and to handle interpersonal relationships judiciously and empathetically”. Emotional intelligence is important because it “forms the juncture at which cognition and emotion meet, it facilitates our capacity for resilience, motivation, empathy, reasoning, stress management, communication, and our ability to read and navigate a plethora of social situations and conflicts.” (Houston) In other words, emotional intelligence allows us the skill to improve communication, build and maintain professional and personal relationships, solve problems, and is something that can always be improved.  There are four quadrants that fall into Emotional Intelligence, they are: Self-Awareness, Self-Management, Social Awareness, Relationship Management. Self and Social Awareness fall into recognition, while Relationship and Self Management fall into regulation. “Those with high emotional intelligence are able to manage their emotions as well as use their emotions to facilitate their thinking and understand the emotions of others.” (Duggal)
Emotional Self Awareness is knowing your feelings in the moment. “Self-awareness of one’s own feelings as they occur is the foundation of emotional intelligence and is fundamental to effective decision making.” (Downing) In college, to be on track to success is to acknowledge and diagnose your strengths and weaknesses, identify the learning style that fits you best, and employ interdependence with something that you need help on. There are many ways to improve your self awareness, as well as many ways that it can benefit you in any environment. During the semester, having self awareness is important in how students made decisions. It helps students understand how their behavior and communication affected others as well as how others affected their emotional state. Some examples of improving self awareness include self reflecting, articulating your thoughts in a personal journal, seeking feedback or constructive criticism for others, knowing when to seek improvement or help, and most importantly, listening to yourself and your intuition. Self awareness allows you to be true to yourself and to others and help you maintain positive relationships. Social awareness goes hand in hand with self-awareness, because it is about “getting along with others, handling conflict effectively, clearly expressing your ideas and information and being sensitive to other’s feelings.” (Riopel) For students, social awareness is the key to being able to effectively communicate with people from all walks of life, as well as to read them to better understand HOW to properly communicate. Active listening plays a vital role in social awareness. When you are socially aware, you have the ability to understand others and empathize with them. For example, in the workplace, a waitress or a sales associate can recommend something they feel is perfectly tailored to your needs. “A self-aware and emotionally intelligent manager would plan their time properly and get the work done well in advance of any deadlines.” (Page) At school, social awareness can be a student who remembers your name or even a teacher. Each of these examples demonstrate how social awareness helps you carefully consider what people like and may not like to better communicate or establish a relationship with them. “Social awareness is empathizing accurately with other people’s emotions. Empathy is the fundamental “people-skill.” (Downing)
For the regulation aspect of emotional intelligence, self-management is “managing strong feelings. Emotional self-management enables people to make wise choices despite the pull of powerful emotions.” (Downing) As stated before, self and social awareness helps you productively understand yourself and how you communicate with others. Self-management is a combination of self and social awareness in the sense that you are using both to influence your decisions. Self-management includes controlling your emotions to solve problems, communicate, being timely. To incorporate self management into your life can look like someone who goes to the gym often, keeps themselves organized with planners and calendars, maintains relationships and their personal life, and positively contributing to their work environment by making it a better place for them and their coworkers. “Leaders who lack emotional intelligence hurt their careers. People rightfully wonder why they these leaders should manage anyone if they can't control their own emotions.” (Tanner) In an educational setting or most importantly in the workplace, self-management establishes balance and harmony within yourself and your coworkers and as well as allowing you to improve relationship management throughout your life. “Social awareness and relationship management have to do with our ability to relate to others.” (Riopel) Relationship management is another essential skill in having and raising your emotional intelligence. In the commercial world, relationship management is used to gain insight from customers to modify and tend to their needs. This creates customer retention, and inevitably, customer loyalty. Relationship management heavily revolves around interpersonal skills. These skills include the ability to bring out the best in people and inspire them, clear communication, collaboration with others, building bonds with people, and most importantly, the ability to help OTHER people make wise decisions and problem solve. Applying these skills and embodying these behaviors is beneficial to become a well-rounded person, whether you are in a professional or educational environment, or simply out for leisure. “Those with high emotional intelligence are able to manage their emotions as well as use their emotions to facilitate their thinking and understand the emotions of others.” (Dugal)
	Thus, Emotional intelligence is important because it is necessary for personal and professional success. Personal and professional success is excelling in what you would like to achieve for yourself and in the workplace. “Essentially, emotional intelligence in the workplace comes down to understanding, expressing and managing, good relationships and solving problems under pressure.” (Page) Self awareness, social awareness, self management, and relationship management all are interconnected and codependent to create one big success variable. Fully developing your emotional intelligence can bring you success in different factors like effectiveness, relationships, wellbeing, and quality of life.

Hip: The History 1,"In John Leland’s “Hip: The History” introduction, he highlights in short stories the influence of many reputable people during a time period that had many shifts in culture and lifestyles. This passage includes small anecdotes about how bohemianism came about, sprouting from the depths of morale and common hard times. Each short story highlighted the importance of how each icon, artist, writer, influencer (of that time period) made timeless dents in history from the 18th century to now, as Leland weaves into his definition of what “hip” is. He writes “hip represents an elaborate, amorphous dance between insider and outsider, high and low culture, oppressor and the oppressed, exploiter and exploited. The struggles are rarely symmetrical, but they generally bring something to both parties (Leland 2005).” “Hip”, as Leland describes, is referred to as an entity in itself in this form of context and is poetically spoken about. From the late 1800s to the present, “hip” and what is considered hip directs the trajectory of peoples’ lives today, just like Hemingway’s style or manner of speaking is incorporated in Chicagoan slang today for example. However, while “hip” was a new wave that influenced the very details of our way of life today, “hip” was also controversial in negative ways. “Hip”, at the time of introduction, was very radical to many conservatives. Many idealisms were a little too ahead or complex for their time frame, for example, the introduction of jazz in the 1920s. Leland describes this friction as a rocky one over time. As we evolve, the definition of “hip” evolved along with “The lesson from these syntheses, which went over the heads of the square mainstream, involved a central fact of black life: that America was not monocultural, and that your rewards depended in part on how well you played the other guy's game (Leland 2005)”. Although, the text does not revolve segregation and the divination of whites and blacks, the text does highlight and elaborate on black culture being a vital part of influence and “hip”, aligning with John Leland’s ideologies."
Paper,"As a child, interacting with others of different backgrounds was no problem. During my childhood, I traveled a lot, causing me to become accustomed to adapting to different environments quickly. My dad had to relocate for his job often. I was born in New Jersey, where I was raised until I was six years old. Five years later, our family relocated again to East Sussex in England for his PHD. My first time in England consisted of being alienated as the new “American” girl, to realize that I had to learn how to multiculturally communicate respectfully and effectively. Being good at communication became a big part of my identity today. My multicultural background heavily influences my personality and ability to be understood by people from all over the world. 
	Going to school, I did not fit in because of my American accent. I performed well and was recognized for my hard work, which isolated me from others.  In England, it was difficult to understand some of their different dialects.There was a language barrier that formed a disconnection between me and others. Northerners and Southerners sounded completely different. It took me a good while to learn the slang and common talk amongst them. The people there aren’t very welcoming to people who have accents that differ from theirs. During my few years in England, I slowly started to pick up a slight accent.There was a language barrier that formed a disconnection between me and others. Because I was constantly moving, I needed to be able to adapt to different environments. I wanted to be able to make friends.
As an adult, my ability to adapt to different cultural environments has been greatly beneficial in the professional world. Personally, being able to understand a multitude of dialects from England has improved my memory and cognitive abilities, specifically, multitasking. I feel that I had the advantage of developing and training my brain at an early age to think rapidly and process more information quickly, all because of having to adapt to different cultures. My cognitive functions are heightened allowing me to have more capacity for memory.  When speaking or writing any English, I have noticed that the way I articulate my thoughts in writing or speech is more formal than others. Unlike when I was a child, it is also now easier for me to make friends with people. 
Being able to adapt quickly in a multitude of different environments enables me to many opportunities and maximizing personal and professional relationships. Today, I am still continuing to master multicultural communication while helping other people do the same. Using my background of traveling and living in other countries, I can open others to new perspectives. Mastering adaptation and acclimation is greatly beneficial for anyone. My experience in learning about different dialects and living in many different cities and countries has shaped me into being a well-rounded open-minded person. "
Inspiring Women,"Gender roles in society are highlighted at a very young age, for example, a kindergarten teacher needs volunteers to carry chairs in and out of the classroom and naturally picking males to complete the task. Even in department stores, the boys’ clothing section has a color palette without reds and pinks or what a vast majority would consider “girly”. While there is nothing wrong with instilling current societal views of masculinity and femininity in young children, there is a fine line between helping or hurting your child’s point of view about feminine and masculine views. A young man who was raised around many brothers may not see eye to eye with another young man who was raised around many sisters. The young man with many brothers may have been pushed to suppress emotion more than the young man with sisters, while the boy with sisters might have been influenced more on being more in touch with your emotions. On the negative scheme of things, young men today are forced to suppress emotions from such a young age that there was disconnect in how they maintain a healthy state of mind and relationships. Multiculturally, young men were raised to be emotionally strong, however, can be easily translated as having no emotions at all. Day by day, we are adapting to the societal and cultural norms to combat situations that can be deeply rooted in gender inequality. Today, more and more women are in positions of power and continue to set new standards and drive the cultural change that is beneficial to both the young men and women of today. 
Throughout my life, I was always around many powerful people who greatly inspire and challenge my thinking. My strongest relationships are with my mother and grandmother, who made me realize exactly just how great and powerful women can be. Between sexes, both genders are scientifically and fundamentally different. Since the beginning of time, men were meant to provide and be laborers while women stayed home as nurturers for the family. While the roles for both women and men have changed drastically, the traditional roles of men and women have stayed the same. Not very long ago, women were very limited in opportunities such as employment, education, political representation, medical care, religious freedom, and more. Women in the past were to focus on providing comfort and stability at home. Education was not common for women to pursue, which limited many employment opportunities that in turn resulted in little to no women in the workplace. Over time, women proved to have always made great leaders, bosses, politicians, spokespeople, and everything else you can name. Even living on O’ahu today, you see more and more female military that are on active duty military service. Fields and occupations that are usually dominated by males such as science and engineering, are now yielding statistics of females that grow every year. You also see more and more women leaning towards entrepreneurship than ever before, with the number of advertisements I see for educational benefits, business grants, and opportunities that are specifically tailored for women. We have now adapted to changes in society for women such as maternity leave, financial government assistance for women with children (WIC), and work opportunities for women that have children. There is no correlation between the most inspiring people in my life happening to be women, however, through personal experience, my appreciation for women in positions of power as well as our small victories for equal rights continues to grow exponentially. 
From a young age, I witnessed the women in my life accomplish great things. Because my father traveled for work, we constantly relocated. He worked long hours while my mom stayed home with us and held down the house. She worked as a freelance writer to allow her the freedom to take care of my siblings and me. As a child, I never realized how much emotional intelligence and discipline it took my mom to handle working for herself while making sure my siblings and I were all in line. As an adult, I realize that women from all walks of life have had to work twice as hard while also carrying the weight of their own. While people of all genders have to adapt to become more emotionally resilient, women do not get the same credit and representation as men. Over time, women like my mother have driven enough change for more and more women to be in positions of power. Another influential figure in my life is one of the managers from my job, who truly emulated what a powerful woman was to me. In my time of working for her, she balanced her home life as a realtor and was pursuing her Master’s Degree in Business Management right after completing her Bachelor’s degree in the same field. At just 26 years old, she solely owned the restaurant that I worked at in the midst of her education and personal job. Having a female manager and owner in the workplace was a positive experience for me. She established a nurturing work environment and I feel truly taken care of while working under her. I moved to O‘ahu when I was eighteen, and without the personal help that I received from my boss with finding an ideal apartment as a student, living alone would be much more difficult than I could imagine. Just being herself, my old manager, and many other women like her are setting the standard for distinctive work ethic and driving changes that present women with more and more opportunities. Nowadays there are more stay-at-home dads than ever before. Just like my old manager, my grandma was silently pursuing her own success while living through a time that did not have as many fields for women to be in. 
	While the journey for equality in the workplace and in society has been long, there has been so much societal change at a rapid rate that young people today still struggle with the deep-rooted patriarchy and misogynistic views that hurt many of our youth’s emotional development. Young men today still make fun of other young men for wearing colors or clothes that are more “feminine”. While this minute detail may not seem as important to gender equality, it highlights behavior that can hurt and limit other people from embracing themselves and their views. More and more young men are creating statistics in mental health that are rapidly increasing due to current societal norms today. Because of the gender roles of men and women, men are expected to be more masculine which can hurt emotional intelligence by deeming showing emotion or affection as a sign of weakness or femininity. The definition of masculinity has evolved greatly over time for the better, however, is easily translated into being emotionally unavailable to show strength. As a result, young men today are uncomfortable expressing emotion and do not pursue many creative hobbies or fields that are deemed more “feminine”. Scientifically, men and women are naturally unequal but both genders have both masculine and feminine qualities. Men are physically stronger than women, therefore, some jobs that are mostly male-dominated are construction jobs, engineering jobs, or jobs that are in the math and science field. Women in the workforce are usually indoors where job duties are less physically demanding. While there are jobs
 that are dominated by either gender, both women and men are given the same opportunities for each job occupation. 
In the midst of societal changes and the adaption to gender equality, a balance of both genders in powerful roles is necessary. Just like a manager maximizing your talents to add value to your team in the workplace, society’s adaption to gender equality has continued to prove equal rights for women is vital for the success of our society. In other countries, gender equality has proven time and time again how it is better for unit cohesion and the happiness and health of your environment. Larger gender pay gaps would reduce economic growth by taking away stimulation from the economy by limiting job opportunities for women. The fight for women’s rights is still going on today, however, recognizing that every woman around you is making a huge leap towards change is a small gesture in doing your part in establishing gender equality. Gender inequality is not just present in your everyday work life but also highlighted in the way society interacts today. The fight for gender equality has been relevant for centuries and is continuing to hurt the success of intercultural and intrapersonal relationships. The hurtful deep-rooted disconnect of masculine and feminine views can be changed by influencing young and impressionable children early on that there are no limits to success, whether it be gender, religious preference, race, and background. Being a positive entity around others has no gender. Mitigating hurtful behaviors like using language that objectify women that are prominent in the media today and telling your male friend that expressing emotions is “feminine” are some examples of what you can do to influence positive change. Additionally, identifying and preventing unconscious bias while you interact can positively impact your surroundings by inviting and emulating behaviors that promote equality throughout everyday life. Gender equality directly supports all human rights and women will one day no longer have unequal pay, lower job opportunities, inadequate healthcare, and a legal system that inadequately supports sexual and domestic violence victims.

The Function of Enzymes,"Digestive enzymes are vital to the human body. Without them, digestion of certain chemicals would not be able to take place. There are five major enzymes in the body which are amylase, pepzin, trypsin, pancreatic lipase, ribonuclease. Amylase is produced in the mouth and helps break down starch molecules into sugar molecules. Pepsin specializes in breaking down protein and amino acids and is produced in the stomach. Trypsin, pancreatic lipase, deoxyribonuclease and ribonuclease are all enzymes produced in the pancreas. Just like pepsin, trypsin enzymes break down proteins. Pancreatic lipase break apart fats. Deoxyribobuclease and ribonuclease are used to break bonds in nucleic acids, for example, DNA and RNA. 
	Your digestive system consists of the mouth, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, pancreas, gall bladder, liver, rectum, and anus. The mouth produces saliva that breaks down your food for easy passage through your esophagus. Your esophagus starts in your trachea and leads into your stomach. The stomach holds food while enzymes break the food down to proteins, chemicals, or other nutrients your body needs. Then, the remnants are released into the small intestine. The small intestine continues to break down food into the large intestine. Then, the liver processes the nutrients from the intestines. The pancreas breaks down food into proteins, fats, and carbohydrates while the liver processes the nutrients from your food. The excess bile is stored into gallbladder and is released into the intestines for emptying your bowels out of rectum and anus. "
My Internation School Experience,"My experience with education differs from others in many ways. Growing up, I moved frequently because of my father’s occupation. In the midst of learning to adapt to new environments at a young age, I also had to learn to adapt to different educational standards. Schools in America have a fundamentally different dynamic than schools in the United Kingdom. In America, schools have a standardized curriculum of classes that progressively become more difficult as you attend every year. In the United Kingdom, their form of education focuses on specific career paths.
In American education, the classes are focused on general subjects and your success is based on performance. Personally, I always did well in school. However, because of constantly being relocated and transferring to different schools, I noticed a trend across schools in America that can potentially negatively impact a young, impressionable, student. Instead of allowing students to explore their interests, creatively or professionally, American education follows a standardized curriculum. Some schools have implemented elective classes that students can choose, but would only be either once a day or once a week. Only high-performance students who have a record of outstanding test scores and grades would be allowed to take advanced placement courses that will count towards your college education. Your years in college are where you study courses that are specific to your preferred career path. 
Many students who attend college right after high school are not completely sure what they would like to pursue. Unlike the school system in the United Kingdom, American education does not embrace or influence students to be their own individuals and follow their passions. While I attended school in the UK, I admired how their education system was more lenient and career driven. High school in the UK was considered sixth to tenth grade, where trade classes were available to take for what career or certification you wanted to pursue. For example, a student who wanted to pursue being a hairdresser would take classes that were specific to that occupation. I was interested in pursuing theatre and art, so my classes were tailored as such. Classes that embrace a student’s creative side were just as important as classes that specialized in math and science. 
Attending different schools both nationally and internationally helped my development as an adult in a multitude of ways. Being able to experience different educational backgrounds allowed me to recognize the pros and cons of education today. Education in America is based on performance and being able to regurgitate information while education in the United Kingdom is based on your career interests. Both educational systems condition young students to be an effective working citizen of their communities. For myself, my educational experience throughout the years allowed me to adapt to different environments quickly. Being adaptable and versatile is a vital skill to have in the professional world. As a college student today, my classes challenge my mindset more than ever which motivates me more than receiving a reputable grade.

Diabetes Letter,"Mateo,  
	I found some useful information that might help you understand more about your great-grandmother’s condition and the reason why you can’t visit her. Dealing with an illness that changes your behavior and heavily affects your body can be hard for some people to cope with. Most people start to lose themselves and can hurt the people very close to them. Diabetes, formally known as Diabetes mellitus, is a very serious disease that affects how your body metabolizes. It prevents your body from properly converting the food you consume into energy and nutrients that your body needs (Cleveland Clinic 2018). There are two types of diabetes, Type 1 and Type 2, where Type 1 is theoretically caused by genetics or an immune system error, and Type 2 occurs from the combination of your lifestyle, age, health, and your genetic makeup (Watson 2020). Although there is no cure for diabetes, there are treatments like a variety of oral medications, insulin pumps/injections. At home, your great grandmother Oma can manage her diabetes by watching her blood sugar and blood pressure, having a healthy diet, and regularly staying active. Diabetes can affect multiple important organ systems like your heart, brain, eyes, and most importantly your kidneys. Diabetes can even lead to kidney disease and renal failure because it causes damage to the blood vessels in your kidneys, damaging vital nerves that control your bodily functions, and weakening your urinary tract that directly affects your kidneys. (NKF 2014). Unfortunately, now you can understand how much Diabetes can affect someone. As a treatment for kidney failure, your Oma would have to go through something called dialysis which is a treatment for renal failure that removes toxins and excess water and solutes from the blood. She can avoid what’s called ‘the onset of dialysis’ by practicing healthy habits and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Even though you can’t see your Oma, you can still be in her life by being a positive influence that can help motivate her to stay strong and healthy.

The Impact of External Factors on Health,"Human health is a complex combination of internal biological factors and external influences, with elements that significantly shape an individual's well-being. Among these external factors are the local environment, pollution levels, population density, and dietary habits emerge as crucial determinants of health. Understanding the intricate relationships between individuals and their surroundings is pivotal in comprehending the multifaceted nature of health outcomes. The integration of herbal remedies and natural compounds into modern pharmacology underscores the relevance of the timeless external factors that continue to impact the health of every individual. This exploration delves into the profound impact that the local environment, pollution, population density, and diet can have on an individual's health, examining the historical context, modern scientific understanding, and the interplay of these elements in shaping overall well-being. As we navigate the complexities of contemporary living, it becomes increasingly imperative to unravel the connections between our external surroundings, ancient knowledge and the intricate tapestry of human health. Ancient knowledge, deeply rooted in the practices of civilizations long past, continues to cast a profound shadow on the landscape of modern healthcare. In today's pursuit of optimal health, the principles of individualized care, preventive medicine, and the acknowledgment of the mind-body connection echo the teachings of ancient healers. The diversity of ancient healthcare practices, each with its unique principles, methods, and contributes to the understanding of human health today. While some elements of ancient traditions persist today, others have influenced the evolution of modern medical practices and continue to inspire further exploration in the field of healthcare.
Ancient Practice
Ancient healthcare practices were characterized by holistic approaches that considered the interconnectedness of the body, mind, and spirit. These practices, rooted in diverse cultural and historical contexts, aimed at maintaining balance and harmony within the individual and with the surrounding environment. The key aspects of ancient healthcare include holistic medicine, personalization of care, preventive measures, natural remedies, mind-body connection, observation, and cultural context. Holistic care includes Balancing fundamental elements, energies, or humors within the central body. Practices often included personalized lifestyle recommendations, dietary guidelines, and spiritual practices. Many ancient traditions recognized the uniqueness of individuals and tailored healthcare approaches based on individual constitutions, energy patterns, or humoral balance. Personalization within holistic care (and most healthcare today) involves understanding an individual's unique characteristics, imbalances, and health needs to provide customized treatments, herbs, or lifestyle recommendations. Preventive measures included dietary measures, lifestyle choices, and rituals aimed at promoting health and preventing imbalances that could lead to diseases. Reliance on natural elements, including herbs, plants, and minerals, for therapeutic purposes. In natural remedies for example, herbal medicine plays a central role, with ancient healers possessing knowledge of the medicinal properties of various plants. This laid the foundation for pharmacological developments. Ancient healing systems often integrated practices like meditation, yoga, or mindfulness to address mental well-being and its impact on overall health. Ancient physicians, such as those in the Hippocratic tradition, recorded observations, symptoms, and outcomes to refine medical practices and accumulate knowledge. Practices varied widely across civilizations, adapting to the specific needs and cultural nuances of each community. In essence, ancient healthcare practices reflected a comprehensive understanding of health that incorporated the individual's unique constitution, the interconnectedness of physical and mental well-being, and the harmony between humans and their environment.
Modern Practice
	Modern healthcare relies on evidence-based practices, and nutritional guidelines are formulated based on rigorous scientific research. For example, health organizations, such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and national health agencies, provide dietary recommendations to promote optimal health and prevent chronic diseases. The modern understanding of nutrition often aligns with some aspects of ancient wisdom. For example, the emphasis on a balanced diet, moderation, and the use of certain foods for their medicinal properties corresponds to contemporary nutritional advice. Modern healthcare acknowledges the concept of bio individuality, recognizing that individuals may have unique nutritional needs. This aligns with ancient practices like Ayurveda, which emphasizes personalized dietary recommendations based on one's constitution. Additionally, research today has provided insights into how diet can contribute to the prevention and management of various diseases. This aligns with ancient notions that viewed food as a form of preventive medicine. With an evidence-based approach and scientific understanding of nutrition, modern practice validates and explains some aspects of ancient material. While ancient practices laid the foundation for recognizing the importance of diet in health, modern healthcare adds a layer of specificity, precision, and individualization based on contemporary scientific knowledge. The integration of both perspectives can inform comprehensive approaches to nutrition and health.
Conclusion 
In our exploration of ancient healthcare practices, our findings revealed profound insights that resonate with the principles of modern medicine. The holistic perspective of ancient healing traditions, emphasizing the interconnectedness of the body, mind, and spirit, offers an ongoing reminder of the importance of considering the whole individual in healthcare. Personalized approaches, rooted in the recognition of individual uniqueness, are prominent in the contemporary pursuit of precision medicine. The focus on preventive measures and the understanding of the mind-body connection stand as enduring lessons, informing modern healthcare's shift toward wellness and integrative care.

The DeMedicalization of ADHD,"Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) has long occupied a distinct niche within the realm of medical discourse. ADHD, stands for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and is a disorder that manifests in childhood and may continue into adulthood. It is defined by the American Psychiatric Association as a neurodevelopmental disorder. A neurodevelopmental disorder is a condition that arises during the early stages of brain development, impacting the growth and function of the nervous system. Diagnosis is typically based on specific criteria and although it is a medical condition, its exact cause is not fully understood and usually is widely perceived incorrectly. ADHD is characterized by a persistent pattern of inattentiveness, hyperactivity, and impulsivity that can interfere with daily functioning. Inattentive symptoms include: difficulty sustaining attention, poor organization skills, and forgetfulness, while hyperactivity-impulsivity symptoms can be characterized by excessive movement, impulsivity, and excessive talking. One common stigma surrounding ADHD is the perception that it is simply a result of laziness or a lack of discipline. This misconception may cause people to misperceive ADHD as a character flaw rather than a neurodevelopmental disorder with biological underpinnings. The stereotype of individuals with ADHD being unable to focus or complete tasks due to personal shortcomings can contribute to a negative stigma.
Conrad's seminal work, ""The Medicalization of Society"" serves as a historical anchor, contextualizing ADHD within a framework that has traditionally leaned heavily on the medical model. Today, the perception and stigma around ADHD illuminates a fascinating trajectory towards the demedicalization of ADHD. This shift underscores a nuanced understanding that transcends the boundaries of the medical model, recognizing the intricate interplay of social, environmental, and medical factors in shaping the ADHD narrative.
Medicalization, as a sociological concept, refers to the process by which human conditions and behaviors become defined and treated as medical issues, often leading to the application of medical interventions and solutions. On the flip side, demedicalization is the gradual removal of medical labels and perspectives from conditions that were previously deemed solely within the purview of the medical field. Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) serves as a compelling case study in the dynamics of medicalization and demedicalization. 
Historically, ADHD has been firmly entrenched within the paradigm of medicalization. Conrad's foundational analysis in ""The Medicalization of Society"" offers insights into the historical trajectory of ADHD, elucidating how the disorder became primarily framed as a medical condition. His analysis examines how certain aspects of life that were once considered part of the normal human experience become defined and treated as medical problems (Conrad 2007). Changes in societal attitudes, advancements in medical technology, pharmaceutical industry influences, interactions with healthcare institutions are all factors of medicalization and demedicalization. The medicalization of ADHD has manifested in the predominant use of pharmacological interventions, aligning with the interests of pharmaceutical companies and contributing to a narrow understanding of the disorder as exclusively medical.
However, contemporary perspectives, as explored in a few articles that I will mention later in this essay, signify a notable shift toward the demedicalization of ADHD. This transformation recognizes ADHD as a complex interplay of social, environmental, and medical factors. The demedicalization process challenges the conventional medical lens, advocating for a broader understanding that incorporates psychosocial interventions and educational support alongside medical treatments. This evolution not only underscores the limitations of a purely medical approach but also reflects a societal push for inclusivity and diversity in conceptualizing and addressing neurodevelopmental disorders. In the subsequent exploration, we delve into the motivations, actors, and societal implications inherent in this intricate process of (de)medicalization.
The traditional approaches underscored in Conrad's analysis reveal a landscape where the medicalization of ADHD was not merely a consequence of scientific advancements but also a product of vested interests. The framing of ADHD as exclusively medical served the economic interests of pharmaceutical companies, contributing to a narrative that overshadowed alternative perspectives and solutions. Multiple sources today, delve into the institutional factors steering this transformative process, where institutions, once staunch advocates of exclusive medicalization, are now undergoing a critical reevaluation. The acknowledgment of the limitations inherent in a purely medical approach prompts institutions to broaden their perspective on ADHD. This shift is not solely a result of altruistic motives; rather, it responds to the evolving demands of a society increasingly emphasizing inclusivity and diversity.
In one study, medical professionals aimed to assess the efficacy of nonpharmacological treatments for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) through meta-analyses. The treatments analyzed included dietary interventions: restricted elimination diets, artificial food color exclusions, and free fatty acid supplementation and psychological interventions: cognitive training, neurofeedback, and behavioral interventions. However, the effect size of free fatty acid supplementation is small, and the benefits of artificial food color exclusions may be limited to ADHD patients with food sensitivities (Sonuga-Barke, et. al., 2013). The authors emphasize the need for properly powered, randomized controlled trials with blinded, ecologically valid outcome measures, especially in the psychological treatment domain using different diets. The different diets include: free fatty acid supplementation and artificial food color exclusions and neurofeedback, cognitive training, and restrictive elimination diets.  These interventions show beneficial effects on ADHD symptoms. The study suggests a challenge for the future is to enhance the efficacy of nonpharmacological interventions based on a growing understanding of ADHD pathophysiology and to integrate these interventions better with pharmacological approaches. Additionally, the authors stress the importance of implementing adequate blinded designs in future studies without compromising the quality of the treatment being evaluated. The study aligns  with Conrad’s exploration of medical professional’s role in assessing treatment efficacy, addressing this challenge for the future by enhancing treatments as medicalization evolves with advances in medical knowledge (Conrad, 2007). 
	The demedicalization of ADHD is a multifaceted phenomenon influenced by societal perceptions, often manifesting in uninformed and desensitized attitudes toward the disorder. The societal ramifications of the (de)medicalization of ADHD transcend the confines of institutional changes, reaching into the realms of popular culture and online spaces. Social media, with its pervasive influence, has emerged as a potent force in shaping societal perceptions, particularly among younger audiences. These cultural artifacts often serve as vehicles for reinforcing stereotypes and perpetuating a reductionist view of the disorder. Such casual depictions, while intended for humor, can inadvertently trivialize the daily challenges faced by individuals with ADHD. The normalization of these reductionist perspectives contributes to a broader societal desensitization, where the nuances of the disorder are overshadowed by oversimplified narratives. On a personal note, a striking example of this trend is observed in how individuals, particularly teens, casually make light of ADHD symptoms, such as difficulty concentrating. As I've seen in social circles, it has become commonplace for teens to jokingly self-diagnose or use ADHD as a punchline for their occasional lapses in focus. Moreover, the pervasive influence of social media amplifies this misinformed narrative. Reels and memes circulating online often perpetuate stereotypes associated with ADHD, portraying traits like laziness and fidgeting as mere quirks rather than symptoms of a genuine neurodevelopmental disorder. This inadvertent desensitization, fueled by humor and misinformation, contributes to a broader societal misunderstanding of ADHD, hindering efforts to foster empathy and support for individuals genuinely grappling with the challenges of the disorder.
Institutions, compelled by societal expectations and a growing awareness of diverse perspectives, are realigning their approaches to ADHD (Trout, 2007). The demedicalization process reflects a nuanced understanding that extends beyond the medical sphere, recognizing the multifaceted nature of ADHD. In doing so, institutions are not only responding to internal pressures but are also contributing to a broader societal narrative that challenges stigmas associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. Education systems, a crucial institutional player, are also adapting to this paradigm shift. The recognition that tailored support is essential for students with ADHD extends beyond conventional medical interventions. Instead, it emphasizes a holistic approach that considers psychosocial interventions and educational support as integral components of effective ADHD management. While there has been substantial research on the impact of medication on the academic outcomes of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), non-medication interventions have not received equivalent attention (Trout, 2007). In the study, 41 students were examined and it focused on non-medication interventions for academic functioning in students with ADHD. The findings indicate a diverse range of traditional and nontraditional interventions aimed at improving academic outcomes. However, the absence of systematic research and the lack of well-defined demographic and descriptive information, such as participant characteristics and classroom settings, are noted concerns (Trout, 2007). Despite some promising indications, the limitations in the existing literature make it challenging to draw conclusive insights about the effectiveness and generalizability of these interventions. The study concludes by emphasizing the need for further systematic research to identify the most promising academic intervention methods for children and youth with ADHD. 
In essence, the demedicalization of ADHD represents a complex interplay of historical influences, institutional transformations, and societal demands. Conrad's foundational analysis offers a lens into the historical roots of ADHD's medicalization, while advances in medical knowledge highlight the ongoing evolution toward a more inclusive and diverse understanding of this neurodevelopmental disorder. This multifaceted exploration underscores the intricate dynamics involved in the (de)medicalization process, revealing motivations beyond the medical sphere and positioning ADHD within a broader sociocultural context (Conrad, 2007). 
Importantly, this transformative evolution is not exclusive to healthcare institutions; it permeates educational systems (Trout, 2007). The adaptation within educational systems represents a crucial dimension of the demedicalization process. Here, the recognition of the multifaceted nature of ADHD goes hand in hand with a broader acknowledgment of the need for holistic support mechanisms. Beyond the traditional reliance on medical interventions, educational institutions are increasingly attuned to the importance of psychosocial and environmental factors in fostering a conducive learning environment for individuals with ADHD.
This broader acknowledgment of ADHD's complexity extends beyond the confines of medical discourse, emphasizing a systemic shift in societal attitudes toward neurodevelopmental disorders. The motivations fueling this shift reflect a collective awareness of the inadequacies of previous paradigms and a commitment to adopting approaches that are more aligned with the lived experiences of individuals with ADHD. In essence, the demedicalization of ADHD becomes a collaborative effort among various institutions to address the disorder comprehensively, recognizing that a holistic understanding is vital for crafting effective and inclusive support mechanisms.
	While we explored multiple dimensions of the demedicalization of ADHD, there is more indicating evidence that aligns with Conrad’s analysis. In a psychiatric report by Alice Charach & Rebecca Fernandez, “Enhancing ADHD Medication Adherence: Challenges and Opportunities”, they discuss the use of medication as a treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and explore patterns of adherence to medication among children and youth with ADHD. The patterns of medication use for ADHD are described, noting that psychostimulants and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors are the primary pharmacological agents with proven efficacy over 12 months. The rates of clinical identification and medication treatment for ADHD have increased over time, with variations based on geography, provider type, patient characteristics, and medication formulation. Factors influencing adherence include parent beliefs, child characteristics, practitioner or health system factors, and medication-related factors  (Charach & Fernandez, 2013). Adverse effects and tolerability are critical considerations affecting medication adherence.It highlights the availability of safe and effective medications recommended as first-line treatments for ADHD symptoms but it is noted that despite their benefits, many individuals discontinue medication treatment during adolescence. The decision to use medication is often influenced by beliefs and attitudes, with some families accepting it as a neurobiological intervention, while others find it unacceptable (Charach & Fernandez, 2013). The article emphasizes the importance of shared decision-making among practitioners, parents, and youth, as well as the need for monitoring effectiveness, safety, and the onset of concurrent difficulties to optimize outcomes.
	In conclusion, the trajectory of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) from a historically entrenched medicalized perspective to a contemporary era marked by a nuanced demedicalization reflects a complex interplay of historical influences, institutional transformations, and societal demands. Conrad's foundational analysis in ""The Medicalization of Society"" provides insight into the historical roots of ADHD's medicalization, showcasing how the disorder became predominantly framed as a medical condition. This shift, however, is not isolated to healthcare institutions; it permeates educational systems, exemplifying a vital dimension of the demedicalization process. The multifaceted exploration presented here underscores the intricate dynamics involved in (de)medicalization, revealing motivations beyond the medical sphere and positioning ADHD within a broader sociocultural context.
Importantly, this transformative evolution extends beyond rhetoric, impacting practical domains such as education. The adaptation within educational systems reflects a crucial dimension of the demedicalization process. Educational institutions, recognizing the multifaceted nature of ADHD, are increasingly attuned to the importance of psychosocial and environmental factors in fostering a conducive learning environment for individuals with ADHD. This broader acknowledgment of ADHD's complexity emphasizes a systemic shift in societal attitudes toward neurodevelopmental disorders. The motivations fueling this shift reflect a collective awareness of the inadequacies of previous paradigms and a commitment to adopting approaches that align more closely with the lived experiences of individuals with ADHD.
However, the medicalization and demedicalization process faces challenges, particularly in countering uninformed and desensitized attitudes perpetuated through popular culture and social media. The normalization of reductionist perspectives, often portrayed for humor, contributes to a broader societal misunderstanding of ADHD, hindering efforts to foster empathy and support for those genuinely grappling with the challenges of the disorder.
While the demedicalization of ADHD is evident in various institutional shifts and societal attitudes, ongoing research, as evidenced in the study discussed, highlights the need for a balanced approach. The study emphasizes the importance of evaluating both pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions rigorously, aligning with Conrad's emphasis on scientific rigor in assessing treatment efficacy. In essence, the demedicalization of ADHD represents a collaborative effort among various institutions to address the disorder comprehensively, recognizing that a holistic understanding is vital for crafting effective and inclusive support mechanisms."
The Black Panther Party Health Activist ,"The history of health activism has witnessed remarkable instances of individuals and groups standing up against systemic injustices, advocating for better healthcare, and striving to bring about change. One such profound example is the story of the Black Panther Party’s foray into health activism during the tumultuous era of the civil rights movement. Founded by Huey Newton and Bobby Seals in Oakland, California, on October 15, 1966, the Black Panther Party emerged as a response to relentless brutality and discrimination against Black Americans. In this essay, we will delve into the origins, evolution, and impact of this health activism, exploring how the party transitioned from a revolutionary movement to a beacon of hope for communities in need. Moreover, we will address why this example of health activism holds particular significance, and why it continues to resonate in the context of contemporary healthcare disparities.
	The genesis of this remarkable instance of health activism dates back to October 15, 1966, when Huey Newton and Bobby Seals founded the Black Panther Party in Oakland, California (Bassett, 2016). This revolutionary movement emerged in response to the relentless brutality faced by civil rights activists, who were courageously challenging police violence, state oppression, healthcare discrimination, and a myriad of other issues that plagued Black communities in America. Key figures within the movement included Elaine Brown, Fred Hampton, Eldridge Cleaver, Ericka Huggins, Kathleen Cleaver, and Barbara Easley, among many others. However, the Black Panther Party comprised a diverse array of young Black Americans, both men and women, united by their shared experiences of discrimination, brutality, poverty, and inadequate healthcare.
	Fred Hampton, a Chicago native and deputy chairman of the Black Panther Party's Illinois chapter, became a central figure in Chicago's activism scene. He played a pivotal role in addressing healthcare discrimination in Chicago and raising awareness about the city's glaring health disparities. Joining the party in 1969, Hampton found himself in constant conflict with law enforcement as he passionately advocated for change (Add Chicago and Lords).
	The heart of this activism aimed to transform numerous aspects of society, particularly in healthcare, by advocating for community-based healthcare rooted in the civil rights movement. This effort gave rise to the Medical Committee for Human Rights (Bassett, 2016). The Black Panther Party embarked on the noble mission of establishing free health clinics across the nation, emphasizing that health could not be fully attained without addressing poverty, which was a root cause of poor health (Bassett, 2016). This transformative shift was critical because it highlighted the neglect and substandard care that many individuals in impoverished communities faced when seeking help in hospitals and clinics. The healthcare system's inadequacies were recognized as tools that perpetuated genocide against marginalized communities (Nelson, 2011). The Black Panthers not only fought for these changes but also championed healthcare as a fundamental human right, first for Black Americans and later for the broader poor population.
	Two years after the party's inception, as both the party itself and its health activism gained momentum, the Black Panther Party introduced the People's Free Medical Clinics (PFMCs) to combat discrimination against Black individuals in hospitals and private medical practices (Pien, 2021). They faced legal challenges due to the 1965 Medicare and Medicaid Act, which prohibited federal funding for medical practices, including hospitals, that excluded racial and ethnic minorities (Pien, 2021). These medical clinics were strategically established in low-income neighborhoods to address not only medical discrimination but also the intertwined issue of poverty contributing to it. The clinics relied on local chapters for support and funding, receiving assistance from local businesses, churches, and healthcare professionals. In 1968, the first PFMCs were established by BPP chapters in Kansas City, Chicago, and Seattle. By 1970, ten additional clinics had opened as the activists mandated all chapters to establish PFMCs. PFMCs served as first aid providers, offering essential services such as childhood vaccinations, lead poisoning screening, high blood pressure and diabetes checks (Pien, 2021). Volunteers, including physicians, nurses, pharmacists, lab technicians, and medical students, played a crucial role in training community members to serve as lab technicians, patient advocates, and community health workers (Pien, 2021). Despite their strength and community support, the clinics faced persistent challenges, including harassment by city health inspectors, police raids, and difficulties in maintaining consistent volunteer medical staffing. Ultimately, many PFMCs gradually closed, leaving only the Seattle clinic and a dozen others standing.
	Over time, the Black Panther Party evolved as it tackled systemic issues that extended beyond healthcare. Initially formed in response to police brutality and racial profiling, the activists expanded their advocacy efforts to encompass a wide array of social reforms. These initiatives encompassed campaigns for prison reform, poverty alleviation, discrimination eradication, food programs, educational improvements, and overall community support. The free health clinics emerged as a central component of this evolution, addressing not only health-related issues but also battling poverty within communities.
	The impact of this health activism has been predominantly positive, contributing to the betterment of communities and the advancement of civil rights. It brought significant attention to the healthcare discrimination faced by Black communities, an issue that remains relevant even today, notably underscored by the COVID-19 pandemic. This crisis magnified centuries-old racial disparities in healthcare, underscoring that the health inequalities persistently affect Black and Latino Americans, who are more likely to be hospitalized and succumb to COVID-19 compared to their white counterparts. (Waxman & Aneja, 2021)
	In their quest for change, other groups such as the Young Lords emerged to address the need for reform. Originating in Chicago as a street gang combating gentrification and unjust evictions in Puerto Rican neighborhoods, the Young Lords transitioned into a community-based organization that advocated for minority access to healthcare, education, housing, and employment, drawing inspiration from the Black Panther Party. This multiethnic organization included African Americans, LGBTQ individuals, Latinos, and women, united under the banner of ""revolutionist nationalists"" advocating for Puerto Rico's independence. The Young Lords expanded their influence to other cities, evolving into the Young Lords Party, as college students renamed them, further fueling the fight for social change. (Fernandez, 2021)
	Jose “Cha Cha” Jimenez played a pivotal role in the realm of activism, particularly as a central figure in the Young Lords organization. He founded the Young Lords in Chicago and spearheaded their transformation from a street gang into a powerful community-based movement. Inspired by the principles of the Black Panther Party, Jimenez and the Young Lords advocated for minority access to essential resources such as healthcare, education, housing, and employment. Their activism extended beyond Puerto Rican communities, embracing a diverse range of individuals, including African Americans, LGBTQ individuals, Latinos, and women, all united by their commitment to revolutionary nationalism and the fight for Puerto Rico’s independence. Jimenez’s leadership and dedication to social change left an indelible mark on the struggle for justice and equity, highlighting the significance of grassroots activism in addressing systemic inequalities.
	In conclusion, the Black Panther Party’s foray into health activism stands out as a beacon of resilience, determination, and social reform during a critical juncture in American history. I was particularly drawn to this example of health activism because it not only encapsulates the spirit of a marginalized community fighting for its rights but also exemplifies the intersectionality of healthcare, poverty, and discrimination. It serves as a stark reminder that health is a fundamental human right, and addressing it requires addressing the broader issues of injustice and inequality.
	This example is especially important today because it highlights the enduring nature of healthcare disparities. Despite the passage of time, the COVID-19 pandemic has once again underscored the deep-rooted inequities in healthcare access and outcomes, with Black and Latino Americans disproportionately affected. The Black Panther Party’s legacy reminds us that advocating for equitable healthcare is not only a matter of urgency but a moral imperative. By studying and appreciating this historical example, we gain insights into the power of collective action and the transformative potential of health activism, inspiring us to continue the fight for a more just and equitable healthcare system.

Firsthand Analysis/Reflection,"Throughout my life, I have been intimately acquainted with the profound impact of illness, viewing it not merely as a physical condition but also as a metaphorical journey of life. With a family deeply rooted in healthcare, including numerous aunts who are nurses, a grandmother in the medical field, and an uncle who is a doctor, my upbringing naturally gravitated me towards a future in healthcare. My journey began as a certified nursing assistant during my high school years, a transformative experience that taught me that healthcare is not solely about assisting professionals; it is fundamentally about caring for the patients themselves, especially the elderly facing chronic illnesses like Alzheimer's, dementia, Parkinson's, and more. Little did I know that this journey would lead me to confront the stark reality of my grandmother's transition from an independent woman to one of the most dependent individuals I would come to care for.
Illness as Metaphor:
""Illness as a metaphor"" is a concept introduced by Susan Sontag in her essay titled ""Illness as Metaphor,"" which was published in 1978. The idea behind ""illness as metaphor"" is that when we use metaphors to describe diseases, we can inadvertently contribute to the stigma and misunderstanding surrounding those illnesses. For example, describing cancer as a ""battle"" or a ""war"" can imply that individuals who succumb to the disease somehow didn't fight hard enough, leading to blame and guilt. My personal experience has taught me that illness transcends the confines of the physical realm; it often serves as a metaphor for the challenges and transformations life presents. As I witnessed my grandmother's decline, I realized that her journey with Alzheimer's and dementia symbolized not only the gradual erosion of her cognitive faculties but also the shifting dynamics within our family. Her once-robust independence became a metaphor for the fragility of human existence. An illness as a metaphor brings awareness to the language we use to talk about illnesses and highlights the importance of being compassionate and empathetic when approaching them amongst each other. 
Emotional Regulation (and Its Link to Age):
Emotional regulation refers to the ability to manage and modulate one's emotions effectively. It involves recognizing, understanding, and responding to emotions in a way that is socially and psychologically appropriate. The link between emotional regulation and age refers to how emotional regulation abilities can change and develop over the course of a person's life. Age can play a role in how these conditions manifest and are managed. The emotional rollercoaster that accompanied my grandmother's illness was particularly striking. On some days, she exhibited irritability and anxiety, while on others, she would radiate happiness. This emotional turbulence highlighted the intricate link between age and emotional regulation. It emphasized the importance of understanding and managing the emotional well-being of elderly individuals facing debilitating diseases, an aspect I learned to navigate through my caregiving role. 
Multi Causal Explanations of Mental Health Issues:
Multi-causal explanations of mental health issues refer to the idea that mental health problems and disorders often arise from a complex interplay of multiple factors, rather than being caused by a single, isolated factor. The diagnosis of both dementia and Alzheimer's in my grandmother underscored the multifaceted nature of mental health issues. It was not a singular cause but a convergence of genetic predisposition, family history, and age-related factors that led to her condition. This experience deepened my appreciation for the complexity of mental health challenges and the necessity of holistic approaches in addressing them. In later life, emotional regulation may undergo changes due to factors such as cognitive decline, physical health issues, and life transitions like retirement or bereavement. Older adults may face unique emotional challenges and may need to adapt their emotional regulation strategies accordingly, just like my grandmother.
Medical Compliance:
Medical compliance, also known as medication adherence or treatment adherence, refers to a patient's ability and willingness to follow a healthcare provider's recommended treatment plan, which may include taking medications as prescribed, adhering to dietary and lifestyle changes, attending follow-up appointments, and following medical advice or instructions. Ensuring my grandmother's medical compliance became an integral part of my caregiving role. Her frequent forgetfulness regarding her medical procedures and treatments illuminated the critical importance of medical compliance in managing chronic illnesses. We had to remain vigilant, ensuring she did not interfere with her post-surgery recovery, exemplifying the significance of adherence to medical recommendations.
In closing, my journey as a caregiver for my grandmother has been a profound and transformative experience that has provided me with invaluable insights into illness as both a metaphor and a tangible reality. It has illuminated the emotional nuances linked to age, emphasized the multi-causal nature of mental health issues, and underscored the critical importance of medical compliance. While I yearn for a cure for the devastating diseases my grandmother faces, I remain blessed to have her in my life and continue striving to provide her with the care and support she deserves, cherishing each moment together as we navigate this challenging journey.

Culinary Essay,"Throughout the course of this semester, I have embarked on a culinary journey that has fundamentally impacted my perception of food. Beyond the flavors and the aromas, I have come to appreciate the profound cultural and historical narratives that underlie the very essence of what we eat. Food, I have discovered, is a living testimony to human heritage, a medium through which the stories of cultures and the impact of historical events are eloquently expressed. It is a revelation that even the most seemingly humble ingredients, such as oil or fruit, possess the power to encapsulate the essence of an entire culture or society. In this essay, we delve into the world of culinary history, with a particular focus on the liquid gold known as: olive oil—an omnipresent ingredient with a far-reaching legacy that spans continents and through time. As we explore the origins of olive oil, its vital role in Mediterranean and Middle Eastern cuisine, and its intricate web of symbolic meanings, we discover the intricate connections between food, culture, and identity. Moreover, we will shed light on the olive oil tree's poignant role in the Israeli-Palestine conflict, where its economic value intersects with its symbolic importance as a beacon of resistance and resilience. Beyond its culinary and political significance, olive oil embodies a potent blend of attributes, from resilience and peace to longevity and the cherished bonds of family. Join me on a voyage of discovery, as we unravel the layers of history and culture concealed within the foods we consume, and in doing so, gain a deeper understanding of the enduring power that food holds in shaping our world.
Over the course of this class, I've come to understand that food is far more than just a sensory delight; it's a window into culture and history. Food is a living testament to the traditions and historical events that have shaped the way it's prepared and enjoyed. It's remarkable how culture influences our culinary choices, and how these choices, in turn, reflect societal values and significance.
Take oils, for instance. Among the diverse options available for cooking, olive oil stands out as a widely used and culturally significant ingredient. Oils themselves can be derived from various sources, including nuts, fruits, and even minerals. However, olive oil's roots are deeply intertwined with the Mediterranean region, primarily Spain and Italy, which have played pivotal roles in global olive oil production. Spain, in fact, can lay claim to being the world's first olive oil producer.
Beyond its culinary utility, olive oil carries a profound symbolic value in Middle Eastern and Mediterranean cultures, where it shares a close bond with the iconic olive trees. These trees symbolize attributes such as longevity, resilience, and peace across multiple cultures. What's more, olive oil has significant ritual importance in the major religions of the region, including Christianity, Judaism, and Islam. The reason I find this food-power relationship so meaningful is that it encapsulates a myriad of qualities that resonate deeply with me. It represents a blend of strength, unity, and inspiration. Moreover, its strong connection to family—a value I hold dear—makes it all the more significant. This relationship embodies qualities like resilience, peace, longevity, and the enduring bonds of family—virtues that should be cherished and cultivated in our lives.
Yet, the olive tree finds itself at the heart of a complex issue—the Israeli-Palestine conflict. These trees hold economic importance for Palestine but face the threat of uprooting by Israeli authorities and settlers, driven by land clearance for new settlements. This issue isn't merely economic; it carries powerful symbolism for Palestinians. Olive trees are known for their ability to withstand drought and harsh soil conditions, signifying resistance and resilience. These trees, which can live for thousands of years, parallel the history and enduring presence of Palestinians on their land. Some olive trees have been cherished and passed down through generations, making the annual olive harvest a time for families to come together, connecting their past to the present.
In the conclusion of our exploration into the intricate relationship between food, culture, and history, we find that this semester has illuminated the profound connections that exist within the world of culinary experiences. Food, far more than a mere sensory delight, serves as a powerful vessel through which the narratives of culture and history are conveyed. Focusing our lens on the symbolically rich olive oil, we've discovered how it transcends its culinary function to become a potent emblem of cultural identity, longevity, resilience, and peace across diverse societies. However, the olive tree's involvement in the Israeli-Palestine conflict reveals the complex interplay between economics and symbolism, offering a reminder of the enduring connections between family, history, and the land. This relationship, encompassing values of strength, unity, inspiration, and familial bonds, reminds us to embrace qualities like resilience, peace, longevity, and the enduring ties that bind us to our heritage. As we conclude this exploration, we are reminded that the stories concealed within the foods we consume enrich our understanding of the world and inspire us to celebrate the diverse and meaningful aspects of our shared culinary heritage. Just as food brings people together, opens a window into human culture, history, and the enduring qualities that shape our lives.

The Health of the Public,"Depression and anxiety are prevalent mental health conditions that have emerged as significant public health challenges worldwide. These conditions affect millions of people of all ages, genders, and backgrounds, impacting their daily lives, productivity, and overall well-being. The burden of depression and anxiety extends far beyond the individual, posing serious threats to public health. This essay explores how these mental health conditions can adversely affect individuals and communities, highlighting the urgency for effective public health interventions and support systems to address these pressing challenges.
	Over the semester, we talked about things like historical and public health challenges using the documentary of the Chicago Union Stockyards, health and health care systems, controversies in public health: smoking cannabis and marijuana, the association between social determinants of health and health outcomes, how maternal and early life experiences affect children’s health, health disparities and how they happened, workers’ health, and ecological views of public health/obesity and nutrition/violence. 
	I believe depression and anxiety pose as public health issues that go undetected in everyday life. Depression alone can have life changing effects on one’s everyday life whether it be situational or clinical. It affects your work ethic, ability to socialize or perform work at your usual capacity, emotional health and well being, and more. People with depression have a 40% higher chance than the general population and are more prone to developing gateway illnesses that directly affect your nervous system like cardiac disease, hypertension, stroke, and diabetes (Tulane University, 2021). Mental health problems pose a threat to minority communities, directly deriving from situational and economical issues like homelessness, incarceration, being in a foster home, abusive home lives, and more. Untreated public health issues cause this cycle of behavioral adversities in our communities and continue to get worse instead of getting better. 
Anxiety, whether by itself or caused by untreated depression, is beginning to pose a threat to the social wellbeing and morale of our community as well. Oftentimes we are conditioned to minimize our anxiety and operate as if the anxiety inside of us did not exist,  causing a strain in one’s individuality, comfort wise. The ignorance and neglect in treating mental health conditions as a whole, pose a threat to the working class society and are continuing to increase as traumatic events continue such as the Covid 19 pandemic, or the obesity epidemic, and etc. Economic downturns compound mental illnesses and ongoing socioeconomic stressors can open the window for developing more and more mental health issues down the road. 
With mental health on the back burner of priorities to find a solution for, the consequences are long term and even permanently physical. 
Prevalence and Impact of Depression and Anxiety
Depression and anxiety are among the most common mental health conditions affecting individuals worldwide. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), over 264 million people suffer from depression globally, and around 284 million experience anxiety disorders (WHO, 2023). These staggering numbers illustrate the pervasive nature of these conditions and their potential impact on public health. At the individual level, depression and anxiety can lead to a myriad of emotional, cognitive, and physical challenges. People living with depression often experience persistent feelings of sadness, loss of interest in once-enjoyed activities, and a sense of hopelessness. Anxiety, on the other hand, can manifest as excessive worry, fear, and restlessness, making it difficult for individuals to concentrate and engage in daily activities. These conditions can significantly impair an individual’s ability to function, affecting their work performance, academic achievement, and overall quality of life.
Moreover, untreated depression and anxiety can result in severe consequences, including an increased risk of suicide. Mental health disorders are a leading cause of disability and account for a substantial portion of the global burden of disease. In fact, depression is the single largest contributor to years lived with a disability worldwide. In addition to the individual impact, depression and anxiety also have far-reaching consequences at the community and societal levels. These conditions can strain relationships, leading to difficulties in family dynamics and social interactions. The workplace may witness reduced productivity and increased absenteeism due to mental health issues among employees. Moreover, the stigma surrounding mental health may deter individuals from seeking help, perpetuating a cycle of untreated mental health problems within communities.
Depression, Anxiety, and Vulnerable Populations
Vulnerable populations, such as those with low socioeconomic status, face a higher burden of depression and anxiety due to limited access to resources and economic opportunities. Financial constraints may impede their ability to access mental health services, exacerbating the severity of their conditions. Additionally, stressors related to employment instability, housing insecurity, and income disparities can contribute to the development and persistence of mental health challenges within these communities. Racial and ethnic minority groups often experience disparities in mental health outcomes, reflecting systemic inequalities and social determinants of health. In the workplace, as a Certified Nurse’s Assistant, I have seen this first hand. Discrimination, racism, and cultural barriers can hinder access to mental health care for these populations.
Furthermore, limited availability of culturally competent mental health services may lead to misdiagnosis or inadequate treatment, perpetuating disparities in mental health care. Vulnerable populations are at a higher risk of exposure to traumatic events, such as community violence, natural disasters, and historical trauma. These experiences can lead to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other mental health conditions, increasing the prevalence of depression and anxiety within these communities (Galeo 2021). The consequences of neglecting mental health extend beyond emotional well-being. Chronic depression and anxiety can lead to physical health problems, as evidenced by the increased risk of gateway illnesses mentioned earlier. By addressing mental health proactively, we can potentially reduce the burden on healthcare systems and promote overall public health. Traumatic events, such as the Covid-19 pandemic and other ongoing socioeconomic stressors, exacerbate mental health challenges. The cumulative effects of these events can lead to a rise in depression and anxiety rates, creating a pressing need for accessible mental health support during times of crisis (Galeo, 2021). 
The Role of Public Health Professionals, Agencies, and Policy Interventions
	Public health professionals play a vital role in addressing the challenges posed by depression and anxiety as significant public health issues. These dedicated individuals and agencies work to implement evidence-based strategies that promote mental health, prevent mental disorders, and ensure access to appropriate care for those in need. Public health professionals engage in mental health promotion and education initiatives to raise awareness about depression and anxiety. They strive to reduce stigma, increase knowledge about available resources, and encourage early help-seeking behaviors. These efforts can empower individuals to take charge of their mental well-being and seek support when needed. Their community efforts include collaborating with community organizations to develop and implement targeted interventions for vulnerable populations. Culturally sensitive outreach programs and support groups can play a crucial role in reducing disparities in mental health outcomes and fostering a sense of community resilience (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2022). 
	Policy interventions related to mental health parity laws aim to eliminate disparities between coverage for mental health services and physical health services. By mandating equitable coverage, these laws reduce financial barriers and ensure that individuals have access to necessary mental health treatments without facing discriminatory practices from insurance providers. Policies promoting mental health services within educational institutions are critical for early identification and intervention. Implementing school-based mental health programs involves training teachers and staff to recognize signs of depression and anxiety in students. Additionally, establishing counseling services and creating a supportive and inclusive school environment fosters resilience among young individuals and reduces the risk of untreated mental health challenges. Policymakers can advocate for workplace mental health initiatives that prioritize employee well-being. Flexible work arrangements, such as telecommuting and flexible hours, can accommodate the needs of employees dealing with mental health challenges. Employee assistance programs (EAPs) offer confidential support and resources to help employees navigate mental health issues while maintaining productivity and job satisfaction (National Alliance on Mental Illness, 2021). Policy interventions targeting social determinants of health can indirectly influence mental health outcomes. Addressing issues such as poverty, housing instability, and discrimination can reduce stressors that contribute to the development of depression and anxiety. By focusing on social determinants, policymakers create a foundation for improved mental health in communities and contribute to overall public health improvement. 
	In conclusion, depression and anxiety pose significant threats to public health, affecting individuals, communities, and society as a whole. The ecological perspective recognizes the broader context of violence in shaping mental health outcomes. Exposure to violence, whether in the community or within relationships, can lead to traumatic stress and increase the risk of developing depression and anxiety. This is particularly relevant for vulnerable populations, such as those living in high-crime neighborhoods or experiencing domestic violence. Trauma-informed care and violence prevention programs are essential components of public health initiatives aiming to address mental health challenges related to violence. The complexity of these mental health challenges demands a comprehensive approach that involves public health professionals, agencies, and policymakers. Through mental health promotion, community-based interventions, and policy reforms, we can pave the way for a healthier society where depression and anxiety are better understood, and support is readily accessible for all those in need. By acknowledging the urgency of addressing these mental health issues, we can work towards building a future where mental well-being is a priority in public health initiatives."
